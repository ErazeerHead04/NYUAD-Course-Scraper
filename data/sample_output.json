    "title": "Arab Architecture In Its Modern Metamorphoses",
    "description": "<p>Architecture in the Arab World underwent profound changes in the last two centuries. Colonial rule in the 19th century brought revivalist styles that mimicked European historicism. Independence in the 20th century gave rise to the more forceful ideals of modernity, progress, and nationalism (or Pan-Arabism) as framers of architectural expression. The end of the 20th century witnessed the resurgence of Islam as identity, and movements like vernacular revival, critical regionalism, then postmodernism guided architecture in its response to this turn. Recent challenges - such as urban and ecological depredations, unprecedented wealth in the Gulf and socioeconomic disparities everywhere - provoked Arab architecture to explore other sociocultural outlooks, environmentalist orientations, historic preservation, as well as branding strategies. This course will review the recent history of architecture in the Arab world from the perspective of identity politics. It will reconstruct the stages of its evolution and examines how it managed to incorporate diverse architectural, theoretical, political, technological, and socioeconomic currents within its still-vibrant historicist core.</p>",

The class will begin with an introduction to the history of the UAE and Northern Oman. We will focus our study on the Bronze Age (c. 3100-1600 BC), when the area was known as Magan and was an important player in international affairs with neighboring polities in Mesopotamia, Iran, and the Indus. Classroom discussions will be illustrated by visits to the sites of Tell Abraq, Hili, and Mleiha in the UAE. Students will then participate hands-on in the archaeological excavation of a 5,000-year-old house by joining the ongoing excavations at Bat.

We analyze how the practice of heritage utilizes historical materials, expressions, and entanglements to assemble and mobilize a more sustainable present in anticipation of growing resource scarcity and other uncertainties. And we come to recognize why heritage - always less about the preserved past than it is about the emergent future - is a form of political engagement with the world's most critical and imminent concerns.

In this course, we will immerse ourselves in the lives and cultures of the Arab merchant communities that settled in China from the early days of Islam until the early modern period. We will learn about Arab seafaring and trade in the Indian Ocean and the creation of the “Arabian Seas.” We will learn to think like medieval seamen and seawomen. We will read the narratives of Arab merchants such as Suleiman the Merchant and Abu Hassan al-Sirafi who  came to China from the Gulf in the 9th and the 10th centuries. We will also read the rihla travelogue by Abu Abdallah Ibn Battuta who traveled from North Africa to China in the 14th century. We will study the history of the corresponding periods in Chinese history—the Tang, Song, and Yuan and early Ming dynasties. We will also read the narratives of later Arab navigators such as Ahmad ibn al-Majid.

Themes of 'cultural authenticity' and 'politics of dress' are unpacked to ask how women used their roles as 'cultural carriers' to strike bargains with changing patriarchal forces in their societies? Pahlavi reforms and Arab membership in the International Alliance of Women feature to illustrate how notions of 'westernization' and neocolonialism complicated these bargains. Highlighting the role of myth and memory in defining national identity, stories that did not fit dominant narratives of the time are explored to ask how do we 'decolonize content' to ensure that we do not replicate some of these inequalities in our own studies?</p><p>Prerequisite: This course is reserved for NYU Abu Dhabi degree seeking students.</p>",

We then grapple with the diversity of ways in which Arab cultures have constructed and performed genders and sexualities through notions of marriage, fertility, same-sex love and desire, masculinity and femininity, and how these constructions intersected with race, class, morality, respectability, piety, and other norms of ideal or acceptable social behaviour. Our sources include cartoons and advertising, pre-Islamic poetry, the modern Arabic novel, postcolonial civil codes, Islamic jurisprudence, autobiography and film. From the construction of Arab genders and sexualities we move to how genders and sexualities have, in turn, powerfully constituted Arab identities and societies: from literary and artistic canons like Orientalism to the colonization of Algeria in 1832 and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.</p>",

    "description": "<p>How do media representations reflect and affect communities? How do people exploit old and new forms of communication? How do technological mediation channel and reshape social relations? This course reviews ethnographic literature on a wide range of media including print, photography, film, television, radio, cell phones, and internet-based social networks. Each week, we explore how media use redefines a central anthropological concern, such as kinship, colonialism, mobility, religion, or violence. We continuously interrogate the diverse effects of technology, infrastructure, reception, sensation, and interaction. Engaging with both \"live\" and \"virtual\" communities, we revisit the methods and ethics of studying mediated relations. Students deliver an initial critical auto-ethnography of their own media consumption, a detailed assessment of a debate in the field, and a final project investigating a specific media community using original ethnographic research. Throughout the course, we collaboratively develop our own experimental virtual community based on the priorities and interests of the class participants. Innovative integrations of art and interactivity will be encouraged.</p>",

One way to approach this is to recognize, as anthropologists do, that sensory perception, which is experienced by the individual as a physical and biological capacity to engage with the world around us, is also always a cultural act. This class explores how gender, sexuality, ethnicity and class are embodied in sensory perceptions and everyday social interactions. Students will examine how our physiological capacities are engaged and reproduced in social, economic and political relations of power which are the outcome of complex historical trajectories. Discussions include a broad range of scholarly debates on the senses and sensory perception drawn from the anthropology of the senses, human geography, cultural history, film, museum studies, impairment and disability studies, literature, and art. The class will focus in particular on how corporeal practices involving food, art, music and movement are perceived, mediated and expressed through the senses.</p>",

Despite several predictions about the end of brokers, they are still present and thriving in different forms and scales. How do we think of brokers in an increasingly (inter)networked, digitized, and automated world? We explore the role of brokers and intermediaries across a range of social, cultural, and political relations and institutions, including gender, media, political rule, public health, infrastructure, and religion. Course readings are drawn from various disciplines and fields, including anthropology, sociology, political science, economics, and history, and we consider how inter-disciplinary discussions and debates have approached the concept of mediation over time.</p>",

Students will explore a range of sites of representation and imagination in the expressions of visual art, film, and the performativity of political activism in studying how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms. While those in the dominant society first thought that Aboriginal people and their culture would “die out” and later that they would be simply “assimilated,” the course traces a history of Indigenous people from urban and remote communities intervening on what Stanner called “the great Australian silence” and asserting their right to a cultural future. This includes assessing the contentious history of debates over the very rights of representation of Aboriginal culture and realities. This course makes use of museums in Sydney, and prominent Indigenous scholars and artists will present work relevant to the theme.</p>",

Indeed, our fascination with all things autobiographical attests to the importance of examining one particular life in order to understand larger issues concerning culture, community, race, gender and even social and global transformations. Narrative Ethnography is also a form of writing which uses the first person pronoun. In this genre, \"participant observation\" - actually experiencing the beliefs, rituals and life-ways of another culture first hand - is the methodology employed in order to explicitly understand not just the self, but the 'other'. What are the differences between memoir and ethnography? What kinds of knowledge travel in each? How does writing in the first person challenge other modes of knowledge production? How might memoir and ethnography contribute to our understanding of cultural and cross-cultural dialogue, while providing a post-colonial critique? In this course we examine the rhetorical and aesthetic rules that govern these genres, as well as the way they create social imaginations that go on to live political lives in the world.</p>",

This course examines the history of forced migrations through an anthropological lens, engaging with concepts such as: space and place; ethnicity, identity; belonging, nationalism; cosmopolitanism, hybridity, and local conviviality; resilience, and integration. It engages with the forced migrations of the Circassians from the border lands of Imperial Russia, the Armenians, and the Kurds from Anatolia, and Palestinians, Iraqis and Syrians in the Levant.  The course addresses these dispossessions as part of the clash of empire, carried further by the colonial, neo-colonial as well as the contemporary neo-conservative political encounters.

That is, they have been at the center of reasoned argumentation about ethics in philosophical traditions and a subject of empirical inquiry through ethnographic methods that examine ethical life in particular social settings. This course examines the conversation between philosophy and anthropology on these questions. What have anthropologists found attractive about philosophical concepts? What concepts have proven resilient to anthropological reception? And how can anthropological research be returned to philosophical inquiry? Readings include philosophical texts by Bergson, Cavell, Foucault, Laugier, MacIntyre and Nietzsche; and anthropological texts by Veena Das, James Laidlaw, Cheryl Mattingly, and others, which examine ethical life in India, Chile, Yemen, Iraq, and the United States.</p>",

We ask how and where to draw lines between religious and secular forms of violence, the ideological work of representations of gendered and racialized violence, as well as the relationship of religiosity to the production of gendered and sexualized violence. The first part of the class will deal with definitional and conceptual issues around the three key terms we explore throughout the semester: gender, religion/culture, and violence. In the second half of the course, we critically engage with existing anthropological scholarship on a range of issues of contemporary concern: 'honor' killings, sexual and minority rights, freedom of speech, violence against women, terrorism and Islamophobia, and the politics of veiling.</p>",

The paradox is that learning to see 2-dimensionally increases one's ability to see and project ideas that also take place in 3-dimensional space and time. Inventing 2-dimensional shapes to express multi-dimensional ideas or feelings requires a high degree of abstract thinking.

This was countered by the \"picture generation\" whose image production was based on photography and related to discussions of \"postmodernism\" and of \"appropriation\". Female artists gained in stature to a previously unprecedented degree (especially in video and photography) and made gender-issues and relations of power a major theme in art.

    "description": "<p>This course situates artistic production in the late middle ages and early modern period in the maritime cultures of Indian and Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea. Informed by approaches from art history, history, economics, and anthropology, it examines the role of cross-cultural exchange, banking, trade, finance, collecting, and patronage in shaping artistic production. Secondly, it explores in turn the ways in which works of art played a role in the evolution of commercial and political culture of the period. It will begin with an examination of the recent scholarship on the connectedness of the early modern world and the formulation of Global Renaissance. While looking from the perspective of Europe and the Islamic world, it will pay particular attention to interactions between the latter and Italy.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This course delves into the fundamentals of Japanese design - both traditional, applied arts and modern/contemporary design - by exploring the distinctive principles, concepts, theories, philosophies, aesthetics, sensibilities, practices and meanings. It offers a means of deciphering the often subtle and nuanced interests, intentions, perceptions and sensory experiences elicited through Japanese design. Our investigation into the obtuse realm of ancient aesthetics - mu, ma, yûgen, shibui, wabi, sabi, kizen, mitate, hana, etc., which arises from deep awareness of the sacred, nature, beauty, time, form, space, emptiness, etc. - will lead to an understanding of the inherent, intangible cultural properties and values that continue to inform the best of contemporary Japanese design. By studying diverse works across the disciplines of architecture, interior design, product design, graphic design, fashion design, book binding, metalwork, lacquerware, textiles, ceramics, basketry, paper making, tea ceremony, gardening and culinary arts, students will gain insight into the multifaceted, integral, processes of Japanese design, spanning conceptualization, production, appreciation and use.</p>",

In dynamic networks, surrealism expanded beyond Western Europe to other regions including Africa, the Americas, and Asia. Around the world, it was viewed as an aesthetic and political tool to combat colonialism and position indigenous forms of knowledge as counterpoints to Eurocentric ways of thinking. This course will examine these cultural intersections and creative crosscurrents in visual art, writing, and film from the 1920s-present. It will place special emphasis on surrealism's experimental practices - ludic activities often meant to encourage collaboration - and its innovative exhibition strategies. Students will explore the history of the movement and also practice its art techniques through hands-on workshops.

What happens when we step out with these questions into a diverse and complex city like Abu Dhabi that is constantly shifting its social, political, and economic dynamics while being host to a transient population? We will begin this course by conducting research at two sites in Abu Dhabi that echo a theme pertinent to the UAE: urban development vs impermanence. Employing various field research methods to collect primary research material, students will transform this research into an artwork accompanied by an artist statement articulating their themes and concerns. Students will complement their inquiry by studying a range of historic and contemporary urban based artistic practices that work with performance, public art, interventions, film, photography, text, and other media</p>",

No other art forms have an accessible history this extensive, which is why the choice to make paintings can be intimidating. However, when we reach out with that brush and touch that surface we are sharing our images with all of humanity. The intelligence of painting comes from its 2-dimensional character because it requires invention of flat abstract shapes to communicate complex, multi-dimensional ideas. For the  painter the process takes place in time as an intimate theater of action. However, in public, paintings are experienced in their simultaneity. The paradox; painting is a process that takes place in time but is experienced without time. When we connect with a painting our empathy with the artist collapses all of time into the present.

This investigation is for novices and advanced drafters alike. The first part of the course focuses on practicing traditional drawing approaches in class, while homework assignments allow for greater subjectivity in applying the technique. Midway through the course, concept development takes center stage, with students learning about artists who have expanded upon traditional notions of drawing and/or subverted them. We study postmodern principles and use them to analyze works of art and to guide original pieces. For beginners, the class will help confront expectations about what drawing entails, allowing them to develop an emboldened drawing practice free from previous conceptions.

In classic physics, all measurements of time and space are defined by the speed of light. Similarly, all artists use the quality of light in depictions of the physical world to create interpretations of idiosyncratic universes, with an implied set of consistent physical laws. Photographers/cinematographers and painters don't simply \"light\" for description of a person, scene, or object, they create entire cosmologies through the manipulation of light.

The setting of an African city which is rapidly developing, yet slowly changing, gives students access to a cultural tapestry, an infinite visual and aural experience, the African experience, to give new meaning to students’ individual practices. This course encourages students to harness their skills of constant editing in their lives, consciously or unconsciously, by employing, this time around, a very technical tool (editing software) to tell their audio-visual stories in more compelling ways. Students are introduced to the video camera, the basic science of its operations in capturing images in different ways, the tools and tricks needed to execute basic and slightly complex visual styles, forms and movements. Students are also introduced to location sound recording using professional equipment to enhance their storytelling capabilities.

The candidate, in consultation with their Graduate Faculty Advisor, is responsible for selecting the content and curating the exhibition. Students will produce an extensive (ca. 5,000-8,000 word) written exposition describing the specific artistic inquiries that generated the body of work. This means offering context about their process and tracing their evolution of thought by critically reflecting on the artists and disciplines that have influenced their practice during their MFA. Critical reflection entails making connections between research and practice. Students should describe concepts and ideas from their academic or field research that they adapt or translate into their work, noting specific formal techniques, uses of materials, and engagements of viewers that convey their artistic inquiry. If other art is a component of research, they should describe how formal elements convey artistic, cultural, social, or thematic inquiries. Most significantly, students should convey a method (i.e., a critical lens onto the artistic inquiry) to their arts practice and foreground how their work contributes to broader debates, not necessarily one limited to art, but at large in the world. They should reflect upon their intuitions in making for how they might be further developed to elicit or evoke particular responses from particular audiences. The paper will explain how their thinking and research helped them with the making. This statement must also include a discussion of the methods, media, and format used. It will also pay attention to the relationship between the student's work to cultural, historical, and social context, as well as other issues (such as social or psychological questions) of relevance. Basically, how will their work be in conversation with what has come before?

The sculptural approach to a given material relates to its common uses. This approach does not alter the material itself, but instead its perception, i.e. by incorporating it into an unforeseen situation. Class activities address the question of how a sculptural setup can give viewers the sense of participating in a situation. Possible approaches may include an emphasis on bodily experience and behavior, the initiation of field perception, or sculptural interventions into otherwise familiar situations. Course exercises and discussions combine approaches to materials with approaches to situations. In the process, the grammar of such practices may be developed and extended in the process. The exercises are only starting points, and may be shifted into many new directions. Such a grammar is not dependent upon any specific material or sculptural situation, but instead proposes approaches to initiating situations and to analyzing them on a structural level.</p><p>Prerequisite: Declared NYU-AD Art & Media MFA student.</p>",

Informed by new technologies, the demand for sustainability, and the inputs from cognitive studies, \"wayfinding\" has grown to become a field of research in its own right, related to both architecture and design. It studies the ways in which people orient themselves via the organization of sensory cues from the external environment. The course explores visual design components and theoretical ramifications and will include workshops on campus signage systems, with a focus on accessible design.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Are art and science really in conflict with each other, as is often thought? Is science dispelling mystery and consigning us to a world of dreary reductionism? This course answers such questions with a resounding no. There is, in fact, neither conflict nor antagonism between the realms of art and science. Indeed, the two complement and complete one another in ways that only artful narrative can fully reveal. A poet, through metaphor, builds bridges from entangled inscapes of thought and emotion to a place of shared understanding. A good narrative science writer must do the equivalent with the often recondite minutia of modern scientific exploration. It has become ever more essential for writers to report back from these new and wild frontiers with clear, intelligible, and descriptive prose. Students in this course will develop their vocabularies of both science and writing, learning to seize upon the parallels between the writing process and sound scientific method: trial, error, repetition, and, perhaps most importantly, daring.</p>",

Seeing is an activity in which the eye and brain work together, and hence it raises questions about theories of consciousness. Students will approach these questions on the basis of texts, cinematic materials, and experiments we conduct ourselves. Classic treatments by authors such as Charles Baudelaire and Maurice Merleau-Ponty will be examined alongside more recent theoretical approaches by Serge Daney, for example, or the connection of image and language in Hollis Frampton's film Nostalgia, which suggests that vision relies on an aspect of imagining, since what we see and how we see are determined by memories and expectations. If vision can be connected to imaginations - that is, an extension of what has actually been seen - is this just the flip-side of the fact that our vision operates very selectively? If so, how do our visual perceptions relate to the visual perception of others?</p>",

But what do we really learn by copying? Would a contemporary mannerism fit in today's world, dominated by visual information? How then does creativity work? How does change happen? Why did we wait half a century before having personal computers in colors other than beige? Why do we seem oblivious to the manufactured filters mediating our observation of nature itself? What are the trade-offs when we delegate creative choices to Google's algorithms? What separates the artists of the past and the brand consultants of today? This course addresses the role and limits of copying as students explore many facets of graphic design, visual communication, and artistic value. The vibrant visual culture-in-the-making of Abu Dhabi and the UAE provide an ideal background for such explorations. Students will elaborate on the tension (real or perceived) among today’s artists, designers, and scientists, while discussing why a multidisciplinary mind is fundamental for contemporary attempts to re-design the world around us.</p>",

In this course we will look at text and image projects across cultures, eras, locations, and across art forms that raise questions about the self and the collective, representation and memory, and about the remarkable as well as the everyday. Sometimes the doubt about attempts at portrayals is philosophical, but it may also be cultural-historical and context-dependent. To explore this question, and to develop skills in art, to experiment with the studio habits of artists, and to generate our own poetics of memoir/anti-memoir we will generate text and image experiments that both create and investigate an anti-memoir body of work.</p>",

We will engage with Trajal Harrell and his company of dancers as he makes a performance that alludes to specific dance genres -- voguing and butoh -- and uses them as theoretical lenses for a new choreographic work that intersects with Sophocles’ drama Medea. The rehearsal studio will serve as our classroom to improvise upon and explore a series of questions about life and art, and politics and performance, through reading, dancing, and writing. In those studio sessions, we will develop a somatic practice that embodies gestures and choreographies that could be read as both cultural exchange and cultural appropriation. We will study and employ the techniques of dance dramaturgy to investigate how these movements and choreographies create and redistribute cultural meaning through bodies in motion. Both the class readings and the daily studio practice sessions offer a vocabulary and concepts that privilege the role of contemporary dance in global culture. And at the end of the session, each participant will make an artist book that reflects upon the experience of the J-term session.  To that end, we will study these topics through the methods of a dance dramaturg, who dance scholar Katherine Profeta defines as a collaborator that “oscillates between theory and practice, inside and outside, word and movement, question and answer.” Be prepared to think, to move, and to write.</p>",

But Muslim engineers excelled in creating complex automated systems, using them as gifts to foreign leaders, as public attractions, or to augment religious ceremony such as daily calls to prayer. Mainly powered by kinetic energy, these automata drew on scholars' deep knowledge of hydraulics and complex levers and included musical instruments, horologia, automated drinking fountains, and clocks that told time using complex audiovisual tools. This course draws on historical sources and foundational science to explore Muslim advancements in automation. What roles did translation play as Muslim scientists encountered and documented the work of previous scholars? What were the basic automatic systems they developed and how do they compare to current technologies? How did they draw on environmental resources to develop automated systems without the need for non-renewable energy?

Though most readily embrace such visual testimony, we might also cede Susan Sontag's point that photos are a \"species of rhetoric\" that \"simplify\" and \"create the illusion of consensus.\" In what ways do a photographer's choices of what to include and exclude suggest self-conscious framing from a specific vantage point? What ethical questions emerge from this tension between the medium's supposed objectivity and the photographer's admitted subjectivity? Students will explore ethical scenarios in photojournalism, travel photography, street photography, portraiture, and commercial photography as they confront questions about consent, privacy, representation, citizen responsibility, and propaganda.

    "description": "<p>This course covers life writing in the broadest sense. It shows how personal biography informs the study of history and society, and addresses the question: Do lives emerge from the societies in which they happen, or can individuals guide or articulate a broader cultural moment? Starting with the traditional idea of life writing using archival sources, it moves to 'pen portraits' or mini-biographies, and representations from life. It is a 'doing' course that teaches techniques such as archiving the present, decoding images, autofictive characterization, elucidating information through interviews, discovering human stories 'hiding in plain sight', and the writing of creative nonfiction. Students will first learn methods for finding a narrative, and study representations of figures such as Barack Obama, Doris Lessing and Mohandas Gandhi. Students will then engage in groundwork to locate stories of the past and present in the UAE, and learn how a sense of place may inform the context of biography. 'How To Write From Life' results in narrative nonfiction writing and a creative piece centered on text and images.</p><p>J-Term Eligible Students Only (for NYU-AD students who have been approved for an away J-Term course).</p>",

Can design, art, and space- making be used to subvert the power dynamic between hosts and guests? What role does storytelling play in the constructions of our ideas of home and place? How has the role of the home as a space of belonging shifted during the pandemic? This course will provide students with a participatory, communal learning environment (a living room) to explore these questions and challenge their understanding of hospitality, guest and host, public and private, displacement and belonging. The course will explore forms of care and learning both in formal pedagogical spaces at NYU Abu Dhabi's Saadiyat Island campus and at the artistic led learning environments in Dubai in the framework of the Tree school, an experimental pedagogical project at Alserkal Arts Foundation.

This seminar uses contemporary Berlin as a striking case study for how images are used (in memorials, museums and public life) to confront viewers with pictures so that they take responsibility for a shared but often contested future. Through the creation of image-based projects in small, rotating teams, students learn how images can either document or distort the past, compel us to action or numb us, and either be tools or obstacles for individuals or groups to be socially and politically recognized.

Today as more and more of the global population resides in cities, the question of how to create community in the context of urban living has gained urgency for policymakers, urban designers, and everyday people. This course will explore the dynamism of Manhattan through the emerging framework of \"placemaking.\" Placemaking refers to collaborative efforts to shape the places we inhabit in order to foster the conditions for community. Placemaking can vary in scope and scale from a small local park to a major tourist destination. This class, in tandem with a sister class on Dubai, will examine placemaking through key concepts, starting with the bigger city and ending with the local public spaces.

Why does The Blair Witch Project frame itself as \"found footage\" even though it's fictional? Why did contemporary poet M. NourbeSe Philip write her book Zong! using only words from an 18th century legal document? In this class, students will investigate these questions by studying and making art using techniques of borrowing. They will write poems by copy/pasting from obscure internet forums, they will hunt down cassette tapes to \"flip\" their own musical samples, and they will download YouTube videos to chop up into their own films.

How does a material’s accessibility determine who its artisans are? How does a material’s affordability influence the traditions formed around it? This course addresses these questions through a practice-based focus on the materiality and production of paper and paper crafting as a global art form. Beginning with the invention of paper, the paper craft movement has traditions and roots on all continents that have been openly shared and handed down through generations. This course is divided into several subject areas: the history of paper and paper making, paper folding, paper cutting, paper engineering, paper automata, and the contemporary DIY electronics, fabrication, and paper craft movements. It will also include field trips to local artist studios and paper mills. Each subject area has associated readings, hands-on exercises, and a final creative work that addresses all the forms explored.</p>",

But what exactly is it about some photos—for instance, Nik Ut’s Napalm Girl, Stuart Franklin’s Tank Man, or Alberto Korda’s portrait of Che Guevara—that makes them uniquely alluring and memorable? What can we learn from the iconic images of our times that can help us to construct compelling photo essays? What can the masters of photography teach us about making images that captivate us and inspire us to action? By analyzing examples of effective storytelling, students will learn to better understand the building blocks of a strong visual essay. The course will help students to discover their visual voice and develop their own visual language. They will also reflect on the ethical implications of their workflow. It will be taught through classroom discussions, photo critiques, field trips, editing sessions, and photo workshops. Students will be assessed on the completion of five short photography assignments and three photo essays. At the end of the course, they will present a portfolio of their coursework.</p>",

Ritual and play entertain us, educate us, gather and synchronize us. They help us to navigate life’s milestones and to grapple with crisis. They push us towards the supernatural and the virtuosic and yet ground us in the fundamentally human. Drawing on theater, anthropology, sociology, and history among other disciplines, this course explores rituals of religion, healing, politics, law, and protest, as well as forms of virtual, deep, and dark play.

The second section concerns physical objects and their collection, classification, organization, and display. Finally, the course turns to the work of modern and contemporary artists who incorporate concepts of assemblage and curation.

The abject, renounced in oneself or cast out of society, takes various forms from the maternal body and the corpse to social minorities and refugees. It implies some trauma or taboo that disturbs the symbolic order of law and norms. This course asks how abjection occurs on many levels and also catalyzes new modes of life and community. We trace it in terms of love, beauty, horror, disgust, sexuality, labor, multiculturalism, terrorism, etc., and highlight today’s abjection that is generated in global systems and revealed through violence or catastrophe, yet also with positive potential. We explore film (Fassbinder, Sissako, Campion, Eastwood, Von Trier, Sono Shion), literature (Sophocles, Boccaccio, Kafka, Yi Sang), art and performance (Bosch, Goya, Bacon, Sherman, Zhu Yu), along with psychoanalysis, feminism, philosophy, aesthetics, and trans-historical material from myths and religions to rock music and cyber culture.</p>",

The use of abstract forms in ornament and for symbolic communication is found at different periods of history and in different locations across the globe. And abstraction has become prominent in modern art all over the world. This course takes a comparative approach to abstraction and asks why human beings in different places and at different times have drawn and carved similar shapes, lines, and patterns. What are the meanings of these forms? Why have some cultures with long traditions of representational painting turned to abstraction? How have religious, political, and social contexts shaped this turn? What has been the role of abstraction in Islamic and other non-Western traditions and how have these traditions influenced Western art?

Whatever form an artist chooses for her/his writing (e.g. diary, essay, lecture, statement), we will approach the written text in relation to her/his art practice. Artists not only make art objects but also write because they feel they have something to say which nobody else (art critic or academic) would be able to express. This provokes key questions: Do artists have a special way of thinking? Can we learn from artists to interrelate experience and practical ambition as well as ways of thinking and writing? Artists' writings provide a context for their work rather than an explanation. They open up new horizons for reflection on their works and on cultural situations. Reading texts from artists such as Lygia Clark, Yoshihara Jiro, and Agnes Martin, we will observe how linguistic form and intellectual structure interfere. These theoretical studies will be accompanied by a practical task: learning from artists' writings and experimenting with students' own approach to writing in relation to their fields of study.</p>",

How does Plato create a foundational myth of Western philosophy out of this criminal sentence? The intersections of literature, film, and policing have shaped the emergence and development of key concepts such as identity, identification, subject, writing, evidence, authorship, and authority.

This seminar examines the textual, literary, historical, and social circumstances that allowed certain works of fiction to change the facts of our existence. The novel is a relatively young art form that began as entertainment, but its instructive empathy for other ways of being has created an invaluable conversation across borders and between eras. This is why novels are censored or celebrated, and why they remain a vital part of the human experience. Examining such novels as Rizal's Touch Me Not, Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, Sinclair's The Jungle, Achebe's Things Fall Apart, Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, and Multatuli's Max Havelaar, students will better understand their world through the stories that move people to action.</p>",

In attempting to overthrow the democratically elected Spanish Republic (1931-39), General Francisco Franco placed Spain at the center of a much wider world conflict. A showdown between fascist nationalism and anti-fascist democracy; a proving ground for new technologies of death; a laboratory for avant-garde culture and its progressive and propagandistic applications: the Civil War has been called everything from a \"rehearsal for World War Two\" to the \"Poet's War.\" How and why did culture prove a weapon as important as actual military munitions? How did artists use all manner of imagery - painted, printed, filmed, and photographed - to battle the spread of fascism? How did even Franco's side seduce some modernist artists and authors to is cause?  In venturing answers to these questions, we will examine a number of case studies. We will begin by examining the respective ideological, propagandistic, and cultural imperatives of different totalitarian states in the early twentieth century (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and the Soviet Union); we will tackle basic phenomena such as nationalism, socialism, anarchism, and communism as they emerged and converged in Spain, particularly in the cultural domain.

The course introduces students to contemporary theories of cosmopolitanism, with particular emphasis on how the idea of cultural difference can shed light on the dynamics both of a vibrant urban setting like London and a corpus of \"great\" works like Shakespeare's. In addition to reading Shakespeare's work and key texts in both cosmopolitan theory and the history of London, students will attend performances of Shakespeare's plays; visit major London cultural institutions; and make an overnight trip to Shakespeare's birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>",

The film started a revolution in cinematic special-effects, but underlying its narrative logic is a deeply rooted anxiety about the right uses of technology. If man, as Hannah Arendt famously put it, is homo faber, the \"creator,\" the tool-making animal, then from at least Plato to the present, human beings have told stories about how dangerous tools can be. This course investigates philosophical writing, novels, plays, and films from a variety of world cultures to explore the vexed relationship between humans and the technologies they create. Why are human beings, perhaps more than ever at the start of the 21st century, so enamored with technological progress? Why is technophilia, the love of technology, so often accompanied by its opposite, technophobia, the fear of technology? What do the attitudes represented in the texts and films we examine tell us about human agency and about the relationship between science and religion?</p>",

What can these tales, and their evolution - and transmission - over time and place, reveal to us about our own cultural preoccupations, as well as the cultures where these tales were originally produced? Through an examination of materials including graphic novels, fairy tales, movies, and fiction, we will consider how representations of childhood reveal ideas about power, politics, and the relationship between self and society.

How did languages incorporate modes of expression - creole, patois, pidgin - that connected with scarce-remembered cosmologies and ways of being to allow for resistance to systems of oppression? And how was the traditional music of African peoples reconstructed with new instruments and inflections during this process? We will examine texts ranging from Plato, the Book of Exodus, Ibn Battuta, The Tale of Sundiata, early African slave narratives; the music of the Fisk Jubilee Singers, Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Nina Simone; works by Amiri Baraka, Aimé Césaire, Edouard Glissant, Wole Soyinka, Mos Def, Common, Nubian Sisters, Saul Williams, Talib Kweli, Tupac Shakur; and films such as Sugar Cane Alley, La Haine, Illmatic, and Belle to understand better some key components of cultural memory and resistance.</p>",

    "description": "<p>We typically think of tragic dramas as staging destruction and dissolution, but many audience members come away with a sense of reconciliation, resolution, and understanding. Aristotle, at least, took something like this to be tragedy’s actual goal. Can viewing others’ suffering support such a positive view? From the time of Plato, other philosophers have been hostile to tragedy, arguing that it gets people too excited and in the wrong ways. Yet another view holds that tragedy does too little, that it is merely entertainment in the service of the powers that be – composed, one might argue, by men for men in order to reinforce a particular political, social, and economic outlook. This course examines these and other perennial questions about tragic drama by reading a wide range of plays from different periods and traditions. Authors include Sophocles, Sudraka, Hanquing, Motokiyo, Behn, Ibsen, Artaud, Brecht, Beckett, Soyinka, Glaspell, Parks, and Mouawad.

The course begins with two plays, Othello and The Tempest, that have inspired adaptations in a variety of contexts and genres. It then pays close attention to the global spread of Shakespeare’s most famous play, Hamlet, from 1603 to the present.

By what means does tragedy take horrific and often degrading experiences and transform them into artistic experiences that are (sometimes) intelligible, pleasurable, or beautiful? Should witnessing the misery of others ever be pleasurable or beautiful? Can we presume to make sense of another's suffering?

And we can observe a huge variety of attempts to preserve memories: monuments, memorials, museums, libraries, archives, rituals, writing, film, and even ephemeral forms such as blog posts or status updates (nothing gets lost in the Web!). The course allows students to sample these various approaches without being restricted to any one of them as they explore fundamental questions about the relationship between memory and human identity: Is memory everything we can remember, or everything we can forget? How can we know memories from dreams or fantasies? Do we remember things as they really were or as they never were?

While \"remix\" is a recent term that evokes studio production and Internet culture, understanding its roots obliges us to go back to long-standing traditions in arts and culture generally.

While news reporting tends to present crisis in abstract, humanitarian or Orientalist terms, how do filmmakers build new perceptions, rather than merely confirming existing ones? This course reflects on these questions, together with the often-fraught relationship between art and politics. Starting with a critical interrogation of the terms \"crisis\" and \"creativity,\" we will explore various creative strategies for depicting crisis in contemporary cinema.

Exploring this wide variety of materials, students will consider a range of questions to understand better how political and cultural formations relate. Is the medium the message? Did mass culture enable nationalism? Are such relationships stable across time and place? Students will examine religious and political arguments in newspapers and pamphlets; nationalist sentiment in poems, plays, and novels; and secondary sources in political science and history. The course’s first two units contrast the invention of the nation in Europe (during the Romantic period) and in the Levant (during the Arab Renaissance or nahda).

Using literature and the spaces of Sydney itself as a lens, this course examines Australian culture as a place of encounters, movements, and crossings. The course begins with literary representations of indigenous histories, European invasion, and settler colonialism, paired with walking tours of Sydney's colonial architecture and indigenous art collections at the Australian Museum. It then turns to literary reckonings of the \"White Australia Policy\" (dismantled in the late 1960s/early 1970s) and postwar waves of migration and settlement to consider today's fragile \"multiculturalism\" in an age of anti-refugee policies.

But what exactly is cultural appropriation, and under what circumstances can it be said to constitute a form of exploitation or violence? This course approaches these questions both philosophically and empirically, asking, on the one hand: What is culture, and how can it be \"owned\" or \"stolen\"? and  on the other: How have practices of adopting or using culture been implicated in processes of social subjugation or marginalization? Course readings are drawn from a range of disciplines across the humanities and social sciences, including cultural anthropology, art theory, music studies, and philosophy. By engaging with a rich corpus of ideas through in-class discussions, oral presentations, and written reflections, students will develop critical perspectives on cultural appropriation as well as the broader concepts of culture, race, and ethnicity.</p>",

Students will get to know what made these cities tick, how they jostled for power in Tuscany, and why their innovations have been so enduring. Our access to these Renaissance cities is largely through art: their buildings, their paintings, and the words in which they were represented, reconfigured, condemned. Thus the seminar explores the way that both contemporaries and moderns imagined those cities, in words, images, and sounds. What kinds of stories did urban Renaissance men and women tell about their communities, the threats they faced from within and without, their hopes and aspirations, their fears as to what life would be like should their cities cease to exist?

Facing illness and death, the prisoners at Theresienstadt forged an underground cultural life that included concerts, lectures, and art exhibits. The seminar engages with developments in Theresienstadt between 1942 and 1944 through the work of composers Haas, Klein, Krasa, and Ullmann, as well as other visual artists and writers imprisoned there.

What registers as non-normative and to what consequences? This course examines a range of writing, historical and contemporary, about gender expression in lived experience as well as in texts intended for live performance. These latter \"textual performances\" capture how artists have imagined and inscribed tensions between gender normativity and variation. How does the aliveness of gender performance (normative or disruptive) negotiate the dynamic among lived experience, textual performances, and live performance? Finally, how do our own gender expressions perform their aliveness in today's world?

The challenge the course presents-one that requires students to synthesize materials from many disciplines-is to think through the ongoing battle for hearts and minds of Muslim youth around the world.

Readings include scripture, epic and lyric poetry, epigrams and aphorisms, autobiography, reportage, documentary photography and film as well as fiction and examples of creative work in photography, film, and the visual arts. How has the process of migration been imagined and how have migrants and migration been represented in literature and visual arts, whether produced by migrants themselves or by others? What are the commonplaces (topoi) associated with migration, from fearing to yearning to be elsewhere and from nostalgia for the home (nostos) to making a home elsewhere? How has the emergence of migration literature (at times located between countries and languages) affected both national literary histories and notions of world literature? Works and even words (including the term \"migration\") have also migrated, and so the course will pay some attention to \"wanderwords\" and to translation as an intrinsic part of the cultural history of migration.</p>",

How might a close examination of falconry help explain the emergence and transformation of social categories such as nobility and poverty, male and female, believer and pagan, citizen and foreigner? How might it require us to confront human fragility - our bodily, intellectual, and spiritual limits, our experiences of joy, love, youth, death, faith, science, and more?

In order to explore such fundamental questions, this course focuses on artistic developments during the Weimar period (1918-1933), when Berlin became a vibrant cultural center after World War I. As the emergence of German film provided new aesthetic principles of artistic production and reception, traditional art forms such as literature, theater, painting, photography, and music were reframed by a new \"cinematic imagination.\" Engaging with the work of cultural theorists who first witnessed the impact of film, photography, radio, and gramophone, the course also explores recent interdisciplinary scholarship in media studies to understand how new technologies shape social and political concerns. A hands-on film project allows students to explore Abu Dhabi's urban cityscapes to create a remake of Walter Ruttman's 1927 film Berlin: Symphony of a City.

The Edenic Paradise of Genesis and the Qur'an where Adam and Eve transgressed against God gives access to thought about gardens in the ancient Middle East. As a foundational idea in Judaic, Christian, and Islamic theology, the Garden of Eden spawned a history of interpretation that helped differentiate these religions. The history of Eden in the art of the Peoples of the Book is closely entwined with that of garden design, and this seminar examines both. The course introduces fundamental methods of art history as students examine gardens in ancient Mesopotamia, Medieval Christianity, Arabian courtyards, Renaissance altarpieces, Enlightenment cities, Persian court miniatures, Mughal tomb complexes, and early American towns. Field trips, once public health regulations allow, include outings to gardens and collections in the United Arab Emirates, and the seminar concludes with a collaborative garden design project in Abu Dhabi.</p>",

This course explores contemporary art that draws on documentary and archival material - the stuff of \"history\" - to create performance, films and installations that tell stories otherwise lost, forgotten, suppressed or displaced. Special attention is paid to how these stories may participate in the process of decolonization, shape understandings of postwar realities, and generate debates in the global art world and society at large. Through artist and curator talks, screenings and virtual exhibition visits, students engage with the work of artists from Japan, South Asia, and Southeast Asia who explore the mechanisms of postcolonial history at the intersection of fiction and nonfiction, poetry, and testimony.

Besides learning a protocol for sustained observation, students will receive intensive training in analytical methods. How do we gather observations without immediately harnessing them into schemas? How do we pass from observations to a set of questions, and then explore those questions? We will, however, explore not only what slow looking can let us see but also what it cannot let us see. In repeated visits to major museums in London we will do slow looking in person. Students will engage in discussion of works of art and write frequent short writing assignments. We will also read and analyze essays that exemplify the art of slow looking.</p><p>This course will be offered in January-Term 2025 in London, United Kingdom.</p>",

How have African societies articulated responses to the historical forces that have converged on the continent? In many parts of Africa, the crossroad is understood as a liminal space from which the spirit world can be accessed. It is therefore where offerings and sacrifices for the gods are left. The African marketplace is also a crossroad where goods and ideas are exchanged with neighbor and stranger alike. This course borrows the African crossroad as a metaphor for cultural encounter and explores the ways in which Africans have been inspired to create new religions and transform old ones when they come into contact with new people and ideas. Introducing a series of contact zones where these interactions are readily accessible - the coast of West and West Central Africa, the Caribbean, the Sahel, and the Swahili Coast - this course will center present day Zanzibar as a site for ethnographic reflection.

The archaeologists working on the site, located on the remote desert island of Sir Bani Yas in the western region of Abu Dhabi, assumed it was pre-Islamic. But, as work progressed, it became clear that the primary occupation lay between the mid-seventh and mid-eighth centuries CE. This raised more questions than it answered. Why would a Christian monastery be established in the Arabian Peninsula during the first century of Islam, and what does this reveal about the relationship between different cultures and religions in the region at that time? For some, this was a clear indication of the tolerant nature of Islam and was embraced as a model for modern societies. And yet the complexities of the site continue to intrigue. This course will explore the archaeology of Sir Bani Yas and the wider phenomenon of Gulf monasticism, including the newly discovered monastery on Siniya Island in Umm al-Quwain.

The primary goal of the class will be learning how to write a paper based on ethnography and every student will accomplish that by the end of the course. It is hoped that the skills learned in doing do will be applicable to larger projects including capstones.  We will explore such topics as the politics and poetics of ethnographic writing, ethnography and social theory, scientific inference, feminist methodologies, immigration and nationalism, and the potential role of ethnography in public policy. Students will immerse themselves in the daily life of Dubai and/or Abu Dhabi as a way to learn the ethnographic method, its promises and its pitfalls. Critical skills for doing ethnography will be developed by teaching students techniques including triangulation, reflexivity (including standpoint theory), deconstruction, linking macro-micro, and variation. Through designing independent and group research projects, students will grapple with how to use ethnography to make visible the social forces of the times, including local labor markets, policy regimes, and forces like migrant exclusion, capitalism, and globalization.</p>",

But they have receded from academic conversations in the 2000s as 'post-national' thinking became dominant. However, the world over there has been a resurgence of nationalist movements. In light of these changing global dynamics, we interrogate how the nation is 'narrated'. Nations are ontological fictions but are also 'real' in a very significant sense - people literally die and kill for them. In this course we explore the duality of the nation through the notion of narration. Narratives 'construct' nations (or imagine them into being) and nations are also 'represented' in narratives because they are seen as 'real' objects. We will explore the literary, aesthetic and political implications of the ways in which nation and narration are intertwined in a range of texts spanning diverse cultures, historical periods, genres and styles. In doing so we will ask how has nation and nationalism been theorized? What are the relationships between decolonization, nationalism and postcolonialism? How do minorities and migration shape nations? We will conclude with reflections on thinking 'beyond' the nation.</p>",

Next, we explore port cities such as Palermo, Livorno, and Tunis that emerged as spaces of religious tolerance after the expulsion of Muslims and Jews from Iberia at the dawn of the modern era. Considering the porous boundaries of Europe during a period when terms such as \"Moors,\" \"Christians\" and \"Jews\" were in flux, we ask such critical questions as: What do works by Muslim, Jewish, and Christian authors suggest about the nature of religious, ethnic and gender identity in medieval and early modern contexts?

What is European?” This course introduces students to the long history of Africans in Europe through three main lenses. The first explores the Afro-European past to develop critical counterpoints to a series of key moments in history: the Renaissance, the Age of Revolutions, the two world wars, and the global 1960s. The second attends to the question of memory: How is the Afro-European past remembered and debated? What role does this memory play in different European contexts? The third centers on the notion of diaspora: How have people of African descent in Europe negotiated their belonging in multiple geographical spaces? What is the significance of the African diaspora in Europe for the African continent itself? Through readings, discussion, guest lecturers, site visits, and research projects, students will explore the complex African past, and present, in Paris.

The ‘Other’ can take multiple forms: ethnic, racial, sexual, national, class and the list is potentially endless. We encounter otherness on a daily basis and given the highly mobile world we inhabit Otherness also often becomes a source of conflict. This course asks a set of interrelated questions about how we encounter otherness from a specifically postcolonial lens – particularly in terms of how otherness is represented. Some of the questions it raises are: What was the nature of Otherness in the colonial encounter and what are its postcolonial implications? What are the politics of attempting to comprehend the Other? Is the Other constructed or is it real? Why has Otherness been important for a sense of self, particularly in colonial discourses? But also how does such notions of Otherness continue to shape identities in the postcolonial world and the Global South? How are academic disciplines and epistemologies implicated in producing the Other? The course takes as it point of departure anglophone writing from different historical and geographical contexts to critically explore how writers using English as their primary medium of expression have grappled with representing 'otherness'. We will read texts such as Leonard Woolf's Village in the Jungle set in colonial Sri Lanka, George Orwell's Burmese Days set in colonial Burma (or what is now Myanmar) and Paul Theroux's Kowloon Tong set in Hong Kong to respond to a set of questions that arise when Otherness is produced under contexts of extreme inequality, such as colonialism.</p>",

This course explores how interspecies crosstalk sustains life on Earth and how challenges such as global warming influence such communication. Topics to discuss include the role of chemical communication between bacteria in causing infectious diseases and whether the overuse of antibiotics is sustainable; how communication between ocean algae coupled with global warming lead to recurrent \"red tides\"; the breakdown of coral-algae symbiosis and implications for coastal fisheries; disruption of the language bees use to maintain colonies and the rise of colony collapse disorder that threatens pollination globally; the potential use of plant language to combat bug infestation in lieu of pesticides; how our gut microbiota influence physical appearance and susceptibility to disease and whether our innate bacteria affect our social interactions; how human communication has influenced civilization and whether modern technological advances, such as social media, have positive or negative effects on us as a species.</p><p>Prerequisite: Must be an NYU undergraduate student.</p>",

This course explores why inequality occurs and why it matters, questions which have taken on critical importance in this time of deepening global inequalities. The course will approach these questions by considering inequality in comparative and historical perspective so that students will gain a deeper perspective on today's debates. While the course will focus on the wide-ranging consequences of inequality, particular emphasis will be placed on the relationship between inequality and government. How does governmental action influence inequality, and why? Does the presence of inequality influence what type of government is possible? To answer these questions the course will draw on sources from a range of academic disciplines including political science, history, economics, philosophy, and literature. However, no prior expertise in any of these areas will be required. By the end of the course students will be in a better position to formulate their own normative opinions about inequality while also understanding how it functions in practice.</p><p>Prerequisite: Must be an NYU undergraduate student.</p>",

Select species coined model organisms have been widely used to study development, behavior, evolution, disease, and recently to demystify cognition and perception. By anthropomorphizing non-human species, we create frameworks for understanding and relating to them. Animal research has also been essential to addressing the global challenges to preserve declining and endangered species. This course tackles a number of biological paradigms where the animal has been a central figure. What determines which animals we use as subjects in research? What are the ethical and moral implications of animal-based experiments? How have animal-based research discoveries been communicated in the scientific community and popular media? And how might we tackle environmental and conservation issues through a non-human lens? As a final project, students will choose an animal and explore its representation in scientific and artistic practices. Creating short films about these subjects, they will give the animals unique perspectives and an opportunity to speak back to us.</p><p>Prerequisite: Must be an NYU-AD student and have not completed the Core: Colloquium requirement.</p>",

What are the goals of individuals who mobilize politically on the basis of one or more of these identities? What are the principles that democratic systems should employ in responding to identity-based claims? And how should we evaluate public policies designed to respond to such claims, including affirmative action, federalism, cultural rights, educational policies, and electoral systems?

Media history is frequently framed as revolutionary, e.g. \"the print revolution\" or \"the information revolution.\" But revolution is a word with its own history, including religious implications, whether as inaugurating a new order of the ages, novus ordo saeclorum (see the Great Seal of the United States, est. 1782), or as a cycle of time, of conservation and restoration, to invoke revolution's older, astronomical meaning. As religious politics comes to the fore in contexts as varied as South Asia, the Middle East, and the United States, and movements such as Christian Evangelism and Islamism gain global momentum, some historical stock-taking is due. To understand the media's role in contemporary global conflict, including the interplay of religiosity and media-led mobilization, students will examine a range of materials and situations, from the use of religion in and beyond the U.S. as an ally against \"godless Communism,\" to the world-wide flaring up of religious politics as the Cold War ended, to our immediate geopolitical contexts.</p><p>Prerequisite: Must be an NYU-AD student and have not completed the Core: Colloquium requirement.</p>",

It begins with the theological conundrum all major religions face: how to reconcile the evils of human suffering with the existence of a loving god. Additional topics include the concept of evil as a rationale for colonial and imperial projects; the Nazi use of gas chambers during WWII; and the Aversion Project in South Africa.

How do we make sense of these outcomes? Is such representation and parity the same thing as equality? Using examples from historical accounts (Alexvich), contemporary ethnography (Boo, Ballakrishnen), mythology (Ramayana, Mahabharata), and fiction (Bui, Unnikrishnan), this seminar will dissect the potential for (and coordinates of) “accidental” equality, especially in sites where its evidence seems unlikely. Grounding our inquiry will be tools from radical political thought, gender studies, sociology, and critical legal theory.

Individuals, religious institutions, and political authorities have sought to cultivate, monitor, compel, or prohibit expressions of religious faith and unbelief in different ways. Thus questions about faith and unbelief have inspired works of art as well as political crises that prompt national and even global concern about peace, justice, and equality. This colloquium explores the study of religious faith by listening to those who find faith alongside those who lose or question it. We bring some classic texts in the study of religion together with film, poetry, biography, ethnography, and history to explore the lives of Muslims, Christians, Hindus and Jews in India, Ethiopia, Britain, Turkey, and Iran.

The plurality of fairness ideals may lead to a breakdown in negotiations, social conflict, or other undesirable outcomes. Social stability is at risk when systems are perceived as unfair. Potential business partners may fail to collaborate if they cannot agree on a compensation system that properly rewards efforts and employees may withhold labor or even sabotage production if they feel treated unfairly. On the upside, a shared sense of fairness may lead to mutually beneficial interactions, social cohesion, and smooth political decision-making processes.

Working among communities, whether as scholars, journalists, human rights workers, or health care practitioners, requires grappling with positions or persons one may find sympathetic-or not. Either perspective is multidimensional, complicated because such work requires spending extended time with interlocutors. Fieldworkers must generate rapport, empathy, and intimacy with their subjects - but without losing objectivity. The ethics of such encounters hinge both on doing no harm and on doing good - through advocacy, opposition, or expressions that are not so straightforward.

What is their value for the future? What is lost when traditions end? Are they sustainable? This multidisciplinary colloquium considers the nature of \"tradition\" in art and culture, through time and across the globe. We will study how ideas, beliefs, aspirations, and imagination coalesce to form traditions and how traditions take shape, forming purpose and power. How do socio-political, economic, religious and, environmental factors affect the formation, evolution, and preservation of traditions? How do materials, content, concepts, principles, constructs, conventions, and aesthetics help perpetuate meaning? Can traditions merge, overlap, or spawn new traditions? By examining how various traditions have structured and impacted human thought, expression, and experience, students will investigate traditions' practical workings as well as their theoretical underpinnings, as a means to determine their local and global value - in the past, today, and for the future.</p><p>Prerequisite: Must be an NYU-AD student and have not completed the Core: Colloquium requirement.</p>",

How should we define resentment, and how universal is this concept across cultures and nations? What tools or approaches can we use to assess its impact on contemporary political events? What are the relationships between resentment and desired end-states like equality, justice, and reconciliation? Course materials will include philosophical explorations, primary sources, conceptual mappings and empirical research on resentment.

Since human communities always develop some common medium of communication, this reflects the emergence of wider transnational or global communities. But it also reflects and ratifies disparities of power, conferring great privilege to the nations and native speakers of the world languages, and disadvantage to non-speakers. What are the implications of linguistic imperialism for the other six thousand or so human languages, and the billions of people who do not speak a world language? Many minority languages are losing speakers and becoming endangered or extinct. Educational failure and economic exclusion are widespread among those compelled to function in an unfamiliar world language. This course explores the processes and consequences of linguistic imperialism. We discuss issues of language maintenance and shift, language politics, multilingual education, and linguistic human rights. We examine the tension between the utilitarian role of language in enabling communication with an ever-wider community, and its powerful social role as an expression of culture and of community and personal identity.</p><p>Prerequisite: Must be an NYU undergraduate student.</p>",

What roles do dominant narratives constructed within different socio-cultural worlds play in shaping individuals' narrative identities? And what happens when dominant narratives are created globally and no longer the preserve of regional societies? Whose interests might such identity-conferring narratives serve? What happens when globalizing cultures create tension between collective memories of belonging (to communities/nations) and autobiographies that foreground exceptionality, individual achievement, and cosmopolitan engagement?

Luxury goods range from art and handbags to automobiles, vintage vines and rare animal species, and many others items. Such goods have played important roles in the history of civilizations, triggering wars and financial crises or defining political and religious values. Luxury is also like a pioneer, making important steps for the first time, allowing mankind to develop its capabilities and expressing this development. In fact, the dynamic of \"luxury\" predates humans and figures in the behavior of mammals. Today, luxury goods are hardly reserved for the wealthiest, which devote nearly 65% of their consumption to such items, since low-income families (the bottom fifth of earners) also spend about 40% on luxuries and 60% on necessities. How does such behavior factor into a pursuit of just societies? How does it play out in everyday decision-making? Students in this multidisciplinary colloquium will examine the history, pricing, cost, and present state of luxury goods across societies and will learn to use scientific methods to envision the roles that luxury goods might play in humanity's future.</p><p>Prerequisite: Must be an NYU undergraduate student.</p>",

But what reasons do we have to accept some such form of relativism? Can relativism really ground our commitment to tolerance? If not, then how else can we justify that commitment?

We also consider the conflict of interest in societies and how it affects institutions and policies as well as reforms. We also consider the role of experts in designing policy. Finally, we discuss the role of governments and institutions in the process of sustainable development. The distressing effects of corruption as well as its causes are also analyzed. In class we will rely on a vast academic literature but also on the policy experience of the instructor who served as Deputy Minister at Treasury in Argentina and advised governments around the world.

As we are now in the midst of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), and dislocated by covid-19, how we live and work is undergoing profound change. New technologies pose new global challenges in the areas of equality, sustainable development, and education. Students will examine the wave of technology-driven transformations occurring on a global scale, including artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and 3D printing. The future of work is explored through literature, policy, and scientific expression, as we anticipate how humans will spend their time as current-day work becomes automated and permanently changed by the impacts of covid-19.

By identifying and analyzing these contrasting assumptions, the course seeks to better understand the challenges we face today, and how to address them.

From the global Slow Food movement to novel approaches to food security and sovereignty here in the Gulf, what are the cultural politics of food? Is responsible eating a privilege or a human right? How do patterns in the production, distribution, and consumption of food promote such subjectivities as race, class, gender, and nation?

Does human population, as the famous British political economist Thomas Malthus argued in 1798, increase faster than the means of subsistence, and if so, what are the implications? People need food and the production of food needs people (and land). The world's population grew slowly, with major setbacks, from perhaps 200 million people in AD 1 to about 600 million in 1700 and to 2.3 billion on the eve of WWII. In just seventy years, it has soared to 7.7 billion, and the UN projects a total of 9.8 billion in 2050 and 11.2 in 2100. How, then, has the per-capita intake of calories not declined worldwide and the balance of nutrients arguably improved? If past population growth was made possible by unprecedented agricultural expansion, will the future require a comparable increase?

Through this exploration, the colloquium pursues a richer understanding of human experience and aims to throw light on the challenges of living together in a global society and our attempts to bridge cultural differences.</p><p>Prerequisite: Must be an NYU undergraduate student.</p>",

    "title": "Ghosts, Magic, And The Mystical: Understanding The Supernatural",
    "description": "<p>Despite the rise of science and secularism, why, and to what extent, do people still believe in supernatural phenomena? Even when cultures or individuals disavow such beliefs, how does the history of belief in the supernatural affect contemporary life? Belief in ghosts, magic, and other mystical phenomena is widespread across cultures and history. This interdisciplinary Colloquium asks how the connection between humanity and the prospect of mysterious phenomena - from spirit entities and the mysteries of nature to the challenging futuristic world of artificial intelligence - has shaped human history and still impacts current critical global issues: forced migration, poverty, the Anthropocene, social injustice, and xenophobia. Aiming to enhance our ability to understand the boundary between everyday life and another order of reality, the course asks what happens when that barrier eases or breaks apart for some. The goal is not to promote or debunk specific beliefs or practices, but rather to understand them using approaches from anthropology, sociology, social psychology, philosophy, and history, seeing beliefs and practices in their cultural, social, and political contexts.</p><p>Prerequisite: Must be an NYU undergraduate student.</p>",

    "description": "<p>What can different notions of the sacred teach us about human relations throughout the world, throughout time? How do sacred sites, artworks, and practices illuminate the deepest possibilities for human connection, healing, and reconciliation? And how do they represent what we stand to lose through environmental extraction and degradation? Historically and today, the sacred has been located within nature, within built environments and material culture, and within the dynamic actions of the human body. As ancient myths reveal, the sacred is a precious - and sometimes tragic - contact zone between gods, peoples, and animals, and it is also a contested place of ideologies and identities. Sacred art and culture also present ethical tensions for research and collecting practices of museums and ethnographers. This colloquium explores case studies from Africa, the Americas, Europe, and Asia, and draws on religious studies, sociology, art and architectural history, film, literature, historic preservation, museum theory, and performance to help us understand the global implications of endangered, thriving, and ever-evolving worlds of the sacred today.</p><p>Prerequisite: Must be an NYU undergraduate student.</p>",

The poet and philosopher Edouard Glissant defined Relation as that which determines points of contact between differences, the modalities of their connectedness, the stories that result from their confluences and how their knowledge is passed on from place to place, generation to generation, like a passing of the Olympic torch. This course explores the idea of relationship in literature, film, and other forms, across time and space. Taking up relationships between different objects, cultures, and nations, without privileging some as primary models that the others imitate, the course aims to reveal unforeseen connections among environmental justice, inter-personal relation, and race-relation. Taking seriously Glissant's argument that Relation is not a relation, unless we consider as equal the elements that come into contact with one another, we will ask, for example, whether we find, poetically and ecologically speaking, a relation and difference between a mountain in Peru and one in Martinique? Conversely, how can we talk about Relation in countries where minority races or ethnic groups live separately from the dominant cultures and races?</p><p>Prerequisite: Must be an NYU-AD student and have not completed the Core: Colloquium requirement.</p>",

Our protagonists range from anti-colonial nationalists in Kenya and Chinese indentured laborers, to prisoners of the Russo-Ottoman wars and convict laborers in Australia. Through the writings of captives, lawmakers, architects, and activists we explore the personal and political consequences of incarceration in sites such as prisons, ships, penal colonies, POW camps, asylums and detention centers.

Exploring interactions between languages spoken within countries (e.g., national, co-official, indigenous, minority, foreign languages) this course asks how individuals and societies preserve and promote linguistic identities while aiming to maintain social cohesion and national identity. Questions driving this inquiry include: What is the right balance between linguistic diversity and national unity? What are the challenges of multilingualism? Of global English? How should governments approach these issues from a policy standpoint? Can education systems handle the mandate to protect and promote linguistic identities?

How can cognitive and behavioral science, with the help of nudges, inform policy-making? What philosophical and legal issues may arise from governmental interventions in decision-making in general? Scientific research has demonstrated that decisions are often a result of heuristics, mental shortcuts, and irrational influences that lead us to make suboptimal choices. As a result, governments and scientists have intervened to enhance individuals' and societies' well-being through nudge interventions. This course offers an interdisciplinary and thoughtful look at the topics of well-being, cognitive bias, and the role of institutions in societies.

But... where does the mind come from? This course examines historical and contemporary answers from a range of cultural perspectives, drawing on academic research as well as literature. For thousands of years, minds, a.k.a. souls, were thought to be imbued into human flesh by gods or other supernatural goings-on. Recent science favors a more reductive physicalist conception, according to which all of reality is just matter, appropriately arranged. But... how do you arrange particles into a mind? One answer is that minds are, put bluntly, meat computers. The course examines the breakthroughs in mathematics, philosophy, and the foundations of computer science that (allegedly) solved this long-standing mystery, as well as further questions about artificial intelligence and whether the computational revolution in theory of mind left out a core element of mental life: consciousness.</p><p>Prerequisite: Must be an NYU undergraduate student.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The legend has it that around 520 BC, the Greek philosopher Hippasus was drowned at the sea after suggesting that some numbers are irrational. The Greek’s rejection of irrational numbers was just part of a general rejection of infinite processes, and the concept of infinity was forced upon them from the physical world. Mathematicians have long followed philosophers in avoiding the concept of infinity, because of its paradoxical nature and the inconsistencies it introduces. It was only until the late 1800s, that the German mathematician Georg Cantor finally created a consistent theory of the actual infinite. Before being largely accepted, Cantor’s unorthodox ideas and monumental work were first controversial among mathematicians and philosophers. Cantor’s mentor, Leopold Kronecker, claimed: ‘I don't know what predominates in Cantor's theory – philosophy or theology, but I am sure that there is no mathematics there’, whereas David Hilbert, another famous German mathematician, said: ‘No one shall expel us from the paradise which Cantor has created for us.’ In this course, we will explore the evolution of the concept of infinity from ancient civilizations to the modern era, shedding light on its influence on philosophy, art and mathematics. Throughout readings and short videos, paradoxes and rather counterintuitive statements will be discussed, inviting students to rethink infinity in an attempt to tackle the question: (how) does the infinite exist?</p><p>Prerequisite: Must be an NYU undergraduate student.</p>",

Poverty encompasses many other dimensions than a low level of monetary income, including the comparison of poor people with the rest of society, which comes under another key social concept, inequality. This course considers the measurements and definitions required to effectively fight poverty. We will evaluate the poverty and inequality trends, and their socio-demographic structure, in individual countries and in the world.

This course addresses the question in two stages: the first part establishes a solid foundation based on the science of the Earth system. This is an interdisciplinary subject that brings together mathematics, physics, chemistry and ecology. The second part examines the interaction between human societies and the Earth system. This interplay is initially framed in the language of ecology, and humanity is presented as part of the system, rather than as separated from it. Later, the perspective is broadened, to include engineering and economics, and then flipped, examining the problem from the viewpoint of media and politics.

Despite their significance, oceans remain largely uncharted, with only 5% having been explored. They host diverse life forms, from tiny phytoplankton that generate half the oxygen we breathe to coral reefs that sustain a quarter of global fisheries. Yet, they are also the most impacted by climate change. Scientists undertake voyages aboard research vessels to sample, document and study the mysteries of this hidden world. However, since most of the oceans are hidden, communicating the oceans' importance and how climate change is impacting them remains a major challenge. This course will take students on a voyage aboard the state-of-the-art scientific vessel, OceanXplorer, to discover how physics, chemistry, biology, engineering and media influence our perception of the ocean. Students will engage with crew members and work on projects exploring such topics as ocean physics circulation, the chemical patterns of the ocean water column, marine biodiversity, and media strategies to enhance ocean communication.</p>",

Could the simplest solution to eradicating poverty also be the most fair and effective? At the local, national, and international levels, various groups are studying, experimenting, and advocating for direct cash transfer payments as a solution to both poverty and growing inequalities. Unconditional cash transfers have become established as development tools for both national policy and international aid. Universal Basic Income (UBI), an unconditional and universal cash payment, has gained ground in wealthy countries too. What explains this wave of interest in cash transfers? What ethical values underpin these programs? What are some of the most significant objections and challenges facing these programs? This class will take students on a global, interdisciplinary study of unconditional cash, covering the international aid revolution through Give Directly, South Africa's Social Grants, the Alaskan Permanent Fund Dividend, Silicon Valley's UBI initiatives, the US mayor-led basic income support, and the global resources dividend proposal.</p><p>This course will be taught in Rwanda and will count as an Away J-Term course.</p>",

It is the core ingredient in concrete and glass and is used in everything from toothpaste to paint. Sand transforms sunlight into electricity through crystalline silicon solar panels and is essential in the production of the microchips that power our digital lives. The story of sand also has a dark side, one that is polluting rivers, wreaking havoc on the ocean floor, and giving rise to a violent black market. This course takes up William Blake's challenge to see the world in a grain of sand. By tracing the footsteps of our ancestors to the present through folklore, architecture, art, and industrial design, sand will offer students a unique window into human history, invention, and culture.

But it is in the breadth and depth of art across the ages that color sees a most significant impact on human culture. The availability of different pigments and the choice of colors through history has influenced both the beauty of the work and the direction of art itself. Using principles of chemistry and physics we will connect molecular structure to absorption properties and color. Students will explore the pigments of nature, those in our food and especially investigate the colors that have been used in art from the cave paintings of early humans through antiquity and the Renaissance to modernity.

In 1995, Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron defined the \"Californian Ideology\" animating American culture during the dot-com bubble as \"the freewheeling spirit of the hippies\" combined with \"the entrepreneurial zeal of the yuppies.\" The next three decades have seen the amplification of Silicon Valley's influence far beyond the proverbial \"California\" of their original essay. Through a chronological survey of fiction texts, theoretical interventions, and films, we will trace the evolution of this ideology from its origins in fin-de-siècle utopianism, through its development in postwar American technocracy, to its current manifestation in international platform capitalism. We will also engage with the \"Californian Ideology\" experientially by visiting some of its key sites in and around Los Angeles and through examining phenomena such as posthumanism and generative AI. We will also consider the ideology's political dimensions, from human capital theory and the gig economy, to the spread of far-right thought among Silicon Valley elites. </p><p>This course will be offered in June-Term 2025 in Los Angeles, California, USA.</p>",

When admissions is competitive, how does a society and its universities answer the question: who should get in? This question is complicated by the recognition of educational disparities in the primary and secondary systems that prepare students for university. Today, about one-fourth of all countries have some sort of affirmative action programs - also known as reservations, quotas, or preferential admissions - and eligibility criteria range from race, caste, gender, ethnicity, and ruralness to educational and socioeconomic disadvantage. This course analyzes the development and impact of affirmative action policies within broader debates about equity and fairness in higher education. Case studies and guest speakers will be drawn from South Africa, Brazil, India, and the United States. Special focus will be given to South Africa, which developed its affirmative action policies under the country's post-Apartheid Constitution of 1996.

    "description": "<p>Observation is always the first step in the scientific process, usually followed by hypotheses and experimental tests. In astronomy, observation is nearly the only way to get data and test theories. For most of human history, astronomical observations were done using the human eye aided by simple instruments. The early telescopes were also aids to the human eye. It wasn't until photography was invented in the late 19th century that astronomy began to become independent of an individual observer's eyes. In this class, students will explore the historical development of our understanding of the Universe through observational tools and techniques. We will start with the instruments of the ancients and progress to the modern era using data from today's most advanced observatories which are no longer limited to light our eyes can see. However, we are still limited almost exclusively to what the Universe chooses to show us through electromagnetic or other types of radiation, since even our deepest space probes have only barely left the solar system. This course will entail several observations at night.</p>",

Are current stem cell technologies safe? Can we clone people to harvest organs? Can we generate animal-human chimeras to harvest organs and cells? What are the ethical concerns when using stem cells in combination with gene editing technologies? These questions are key to understand stem cell - and gene editing-based therapies, their practical applications, and their safety and ethical considerations. We will read and discuss the literature describing milestones in stem cell research and genome editing and gain practical training in growing and differentiating embryonic stem cells. We will also review the ethical and political issues regarding the use of stem cells.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Pandemics share much in common with other disturbances in human-environmental systems--tipping points and non-linearities that make behavior counter-intuitive and hard to predict. Some processes change quickly or are very local; others shift slowly and reshape entire regions or nations. This mix of scales and connections affords the opportunity to ask (via models) a range of questions about people, their interactions, and their relationships with the environment. However, models must always be used with caution. They are built to answer particular questions and represent a set of assumptions about how a system behaves. Understanding how those assumptions shape and limit the range of inferences that can be made is critical for any model output to be treated as knowledge. Applying models critically across a wide range of problems, students will ask when we should (or shouldn’t) model, and what our models can and can’t tell us. No coding experience is necessary, but students should expect to make use of algebra and basic statistics.</p>",

This course explores how and why we acquired our unique behavioral and anatomical characteristics as viewed through a comparative and evolutionary lens. It examines the evolutionary origins of cognition, bipedalism, hairlessness, hunting and gathering, technology, cooking, extended life history, cooperation, and warfare.

We will discuss the history of the concept of zero, ideas of nothing and everything in ancient philosophy, the concept of limit, which is at the heart of modern mathematics, and the theories of relativity and quantum physics, which represent the foundations of our modern understanding of the universe. We will ask age-old questions that have occupied natural philosophers for millennia: Why is there something rather than nothing? Where does everything come from? Can something come from nothing? What is nothing anyway? Along the way, we will see how developing scientific theories requires taking basic concepts---like the concept of \"nothingness\"---and making them precise enough to support scientific inquiry.

Einstein’s theory of relativity completely altered notions of time and space, laying the theoretical foundation for the use of nuclear power. At the same time, a new quantum theory was developed to describe the behavior of atoms and nuclei. It led to great technological advances, with much modern technology crucially exploiting quantum effects. But the revolutionary advent of relativity and quantum mechanics came with significant consequences: Physics became detached from the public’s everyday experiences and intuition. Challenging that notion of inaccessibility, this course analyzes some of the basic concepts of relativity and quantum theory.</p>",

Zero was discovered and accepted as a number 1500 years ago; it was considered a dangerous idea in some civilizations. The existence of infinity was fiercely debated by philosophers as well as mathematicians. Understanding numbers requires insights from the liberal arts of the ancient quadrivium (arithmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy) considered in their unity through their relationships with numbers. Pythagoras, Plato, Al-Kindi, Kepler, Turing, Mandelbrot and others have thought about concepts of measure, order, chaos, harmony, unity, diversity and universality.

After discussing general theories of revolutions, the course turns to the early modern democratic revolutions in England (1688) and France (1789), then turn to the Marxist-inspired revolutions in Russia (1917) and China (1949), anti-colonial revolutions in the United States (1776), Latin America (19th century), and Africa (mostly post-WWII), and conclude with the revolutions in Iran (1979) and North Africa and the Middle East known as \"Arab Spring\" (early 2010s).</p>",

    "description": "<p>When modern democracies were established, the aristocracies they replaced faced varying fortunes. Some were wiped out. Others lost political power but retained social status and economic power. Some maintained political power through institutions set aside for them. And others remained a ruling class, reinvented through democracy. This course draws on history, political science, anthropology, and literature to raise the following questions: How did the aristocracy’s fate vary when democracy was established? And how do these varying fortunes affect democratic politics? The course’s first half, in Abu Dhabi, will focus on conceptual and theoretical questions, comparing the UK, Zambia, Japan, the US, South Asia, and the Middle East. The course’s second half will include a field trip to India, where the aristocracy suffered a significant political decline, but was not wiped out, and has recently been reinventing itself. We will spend a week with members of how the old aristocracy, including those who are politically successful now and those who failed, and visit their constituencies to understand what their success and failure means for democratic representation.</p>",

From the earliest use of spies and informers to contemporary techniques of identification and mass surveillance (such as census-taking, passports, and identify cards), students will explore key questions such as: (1) What is the relationship between surveillance and governance? (2) How has electronic surveillance changed the ways in which we think about individual identity and privacy?  (3) Can we balance a concern for individual freedom with the pursuit of security? The course will also focus on key historical debates about the appropriate limits of surveillance, including uses of information gathered from online behavior and social media.</p>",

Although democracy and equality have been deeply linked in the history of political thought, critics of democratic practice argue that formal equality among citizens has rarely prevented substantive economic and political inequalities from arising - inequalities that seem to call into question the very democratic character of self-described democratic states. We begin by examining one of history’s most radical and influential democracies, ancient Athens. After reading Thucydides’ complex account of democratic Athens at war, we will turn to ancient debates about democracy found in such authors as Aristophanes, Isocrates, Xenophon, Plato, and Aristotle. We then will compare these arguments to subsequent ones by Madison, Mill, Marx, Rawls, Dworkin, Przeworski, and Sen.

So how much of what we call \"scientific progress\" is the result of social negotiation, and how much is rational deliberation? That is the big question this course investigates - the question of the competing roles of rationality and rhetoric in the development of science. Do theoretical pictures change on account of reasoned argument, or rhetorical persuasion? The course examines this question through the lens of several important scientific revolutions, particularly the quantum one. The starting point will be Thomas Kuhn’s influential account of scientific progress. Does his picture really fit the historical facts? Several competing models of scientific progress will also be discussed. Along the way, students will consider why many scientific revolutions occurred in Europe and not elsewhere.

These and many more questions will not receive a definitive answer in this highly experimental course. But we will criss-cross the world's many religious and philosophical traditions, in an effort to understand what is involved in any attempt to understand the ineffable.</p>",

The first is to introduce three broad traditions of normative thinking about social issues from around the globe: a Confucian tradition, one based in Islamic legal traditions, and one derived from European liberalism. The second is to address three current areas of normative debate: about global economic inequality, about gender justice, and about human rights. Students will explore these ethical controversies against the background of the three broad traditions. The aim of the course will be to understand some of the differences of approach that shape the global conversation about these issues.</p>",

This course reviews the history of cities from prehistoric times to the middle ages and then on to contemporary urbanization in both the advanced and less developed worlds. The role of medieval cities as cradles of capitalism and state-building will receive particular attention. This will be followed by a summary review of the successive cycles of world economic development under Spanish, Dutch, British, and then American hegemony. How cities evolved during each of these cycles and how they harbored and nurtured multiple economic and political changes that ushered the modern world will be examined. The final part of the course will be dedicated to contemporary urbanization in the post-industrial cities of the United States and Europe and the major capitals of the less developed world. The character and significance of “global cities” will be discussed, comparing established ones such as New York and London with emerging ones, in particular Dubai and Miami. Topics include the rapidly growing economic and social inequalities in cities, both of the advanced and less developed nations, and to the role of the informal economy in both.</p>",

We begin with general theoretical debates, then examine the dynamics of power at all levels of social life, from interpersonal interaction to global economic hegemony. We explore power in families, in gender relations, in conflicts between racial and ethnic groups, power in the capitalist economy, in different types of political systems, and in geopolitics and warfare.

We will discuss the evolution and definition of the concept of well-being and its increasing use by public officials as both aspiration and metric. We will then examine how the design of the built environment affects well-being through three of its determinants: mobility: how people move from place to place in their daily lives; social connections: the effects on people of pro-social public and communal spaces; and nature contact: the type and extent of contact people have with greenery and the natural world. Assignments will use three areas of Abu Dhabi as case studies. Students will learn through interactive lectures and classroom discussions and debates; guest lectures; the screening of documentary films and TED talks; a small ethnographic project on campus; field exercises in two contrasting neighborhoods of Abu Dhabi - a dense older central district and a new suburb; and a design project on Saadiyat Island.</p><p>This course will be offered in January-Term 2025 in Abu Dhabi.</p>",

Can gender be theorized across cultures in ways that adequately address inegalitarian sociopolitical and economic conditions? A body of thought that arose to explain how gender creates social meaning, feminist theory has evolved to address the political impacts of gender’s intersection with race, class, nationalism, sexual orientation, and other categories. Its interdisciplinarity allows for broad applicability and has secured ongoing relevance for global civic engagement. The course begins with a look at “first wave” or “liberal” feminism’s battles for women’s economic, political, and domestic parity with men before examining how post-structural feminist and queer theory has questioned the very basis of gender difference as social construct. How have rights-based approaches to equality provoked socialist and Marxist, postcolonial, or Islamist critiques? Can feminist theory confront the ethical imperative for global citizens to improve conditions for everyone regardless of sex, gender, race, class, or creed?</p>",

Bringing global and critical perspectives to bear on such questions, the course reckons with the realization that optimal mobility systems are a constantly moving target. Drawing on material from multiple disciplines, students will examine changes and challenges throughout history and across regions as they ask how mobility shapes cities, how physical mobility relates to \"upward\" social mobility, and how planners and citizens might better address the mobility needs and wellbeing of diverse groups. Students will engage in ongoing debates and will explore different media (e.g. animations, photography, essays) to address such questions.</p>",

New research, however, explores the possibility that biological differences may help to explain variations in political beliefs and participation. This course explores the relationship between biology and politics with an emphasis on how the two may be linked. In addition to examining the theoretical arguments used to study the biological basis of political beliefs and behaviors, students will examine concepts from genetics, neuroscience, psychophysiology, psychology, and evolutionary theory.

Those who manage to cross international borders confront a global refugee system in crisis, with no consensus as to how it should be reformed. This course explores the history of the international refugee regime and the limitations of international law and governance. It asks how the ever-present tension between the sovereign right of states to control their borders and the international duties owed to refugees has influenced the way that international law has been shaped and interpreted by countries across the world’s major regions. Taking a comparative approach via African, Latin American, Asian, European and Middle Eastern case studies, the course will conclude by examining the UN Global Compact for Migration, adopted in Dec 2018, which provides an occasion for critical analysis of the international community’s attempt to create an effective and humane regime for protecting refugees.</p>",

In the wake of the oil boom, however, these settlements quickly transformed into modern cities, later becoming - due to the massive influx of expat workers - large-scale urban agglomerations (with 1 to 3M inhabitants). The UAE’s metropolises stand out due to the tremendous pace with which they globalized, but these developments have also given rise to a variety of social problems and challenges. This seminar approaches these problems by examining the social fabric in each of these cities. How are UAE urban spaces marked by differences of social class, gender, ethnic and national affiliations, and religion? What kind of community spaces have emerged in past and present? What can their built environments teach us about local histories of inter-ethnic relationships? In what ways do urban built environments reflect state politics? Can UAE cities expand endlessly, and with what consequences for natural and social environments? What can these cities teach us about the social politics and future of urban life in general?</p>",

Focusing on the western legal tradition and its increasingly global implications, this course critically approaches various theories of property while constantly attending to contemporary debates about the institution and its legitimacy. The method is genealogical. After a brief presentation of premodern conceptions, the course will follow the rise and triumph of the canonical definition of Property as a subjective, absolute and exclusive right, through the careful study of conflicting theories about its nature, origins, grounds, purposes. What challenges have these canonical definitions faced - whether through social, analytical, or realist critique - and what implications do current ways of theorizing property have for its future?</p>",

But we also often wish to be politically more autonomous, that is to be the authors of the laws we are subjected to. When the law is made only by lawyers and only based on legal technique, we think some important principles of political freedom are lost. This course aims to inquire about this paradox. To do so, the course will begin with a moment, at the end of the 18th century, when realizing political autonomy came by exiting the western legal tradition, but through law, imagining something like a “law without lawyers.” It will then study the reaction to and internalization of this project by eminent Jurists. In what ways has the resulting status quo defined the structure of modern law and legal science? Does raising such a question depend on an ongoing negotiation between law and politics? What narratives might we develop in order to understand the roles played by law and legal science (and their critique) in establishing supposedly politically autonomous societies?</p>",

Such general questions have been taken up within a range of disciplines in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. Although there are multiple approaches and answers put forward within these different domains, they all share a basic vocabulary.

But some tension exists between its individual and social effects. Communication systems are shared, but individuals have distinct identities, experiences, and things to say. They have different versions of a language and do different things with it. At the macro-social level, policy planning, official languages, and language education both help and hinder efforts to promote human understanding and international cooperation. Exploring such contrasting imperatives, the course asks: How does language create and perform identity? How does it reflect social organization and order? How are communication or conflict enabled or affected by language change or the emergence of dialects or social registers? Students will explore research methods to study dynamics of linguistic conformity (social norms and institutions, power dynamics) and individual usage (language acquisition, personal networks, stylistic variation, and social accommodation) that bear on our efforts to understand language as a defining human characteristic.</p>",

We also survey the historical emergence of the global environmental justice [EJ] movement, led by residents of underserved urban communities who felt excluded by mainstream environmentalism, and explore how political and technocratic visions for achieving sustainability mitigate or worsen inequality. The readings span the social sciences and history. We will explore case studies of environmental inequality and EJ initiatives from around the globe, with special attention to the UAE. Of particular interest is Masdar City, the UAE’s attempt to construct the world’s first carbon-neutral city. Based on a site visit, analyses of plans, and a critical reading of the literature regarding Masdar City, we will ask what Masdar can teach us about achieving EJ in the 21st century.</p>",

In this course we’ll discuss the views of a variety of anthropologists, philosophers and sociologists as to what religions are; theories that seek to explain not just what, if anything, these many diverse religions have in common but the moral, social or cognitive purposes they serve. Among our theorists will be some of the founders of modern Western social science - E. B. Tylor, Max Weber, and Emile Durkheim. Among our questions will be, “Is religion a European concept?”</p>",

Amid the various celebrations of coexistence, however, there has been relatively little discussion of the underlying idea. What is tolerance, and why is it a good thing? The answers to these questions may seem obvious: for those of us already invested in peaceful coexistence with members of different religions, the benefits of tolerance are clear. But what about people who are not yet committed to coexistence? Are there defenses of tolerance that even people who reject the idea that all religions are equally valid or valuable might find compelling? Can we, in other words, find arguments for tolerance that speak to fundamentalists? If not, can we nevertheless organize society in a genuinely tolerant manner without thereby being intolerant of more traditional or conservative ways of life?

If we think of \"place\" as a geographical location tied to a particular community, movement to another place challenges assumptions about belonging and connections. If \"place\" is governed by the state, then migration will likely be constructed as a crisis. Two facts question this framing. First, international migration has remained stable since 1950 (about 3 percent of the world's population). What has changed since then is the direction of migration and the proportion going to different places. Second, migration has been a basic survival strategy throughout human history. Literary accounts from Homer's Odyssey to Hamid's Exit West wrestle with migration's causes and consequences. Taking this longer view, the course examines historical and contemporary fiction about migration and the making of borders.

These works also draw on the physical and social sciences and humanities to illustrate important themes: geo-engineering; the human cost of climate change; the science of prediction; climate-induced conflict; the ethics of violent protest; interdependence; accountability and governance; and the problematic primacy of human life on Earth. In each meeting, we discuss a few fiction chapters together with shorter works on the science, ethics, and meaning of climate change.</p>",

    "title": "Justice",
    "description": "<p>What does it mean to act justly? In Book I of Politics, Aristotle says that \"justice is the bond of men in states\" and that \"the determination of what is just is the principle of order in political society.\" Aristotle’s point is that justice is not merely personal, but depends on the social practices and institutions that determine how social life turns out to be. He implies by this that we are responsible for the ordering of our communities, not merely for our particular actions. The way the world is around us and the way in which the burdens and benefits of social life are allocated is not something that just happens, a matter of the natural world. These are determined by human choice and action. This realization opens up a domain of moral inquiry that concerns the justification of the institutions that allocate benefits and burdens in the social world. This course takes up six  such questions of justice: war, criminal punishment, citizenship, poverty, inequality, and snobbery. In it, students will explore the idea of justice for institutions through examples of legal and political controversy, combining ancient and modern readings.</p>",

Leveraging psychology and neuroscience, this course draws from practices and strategies of high performers to decipher what it takes to be in flow, that state of consciousness where performance is exceptional, consistent, and automatic. Using varied activities to generate personalized insights, the course will center students as the case study. Students will define their sense of purpose and examine their habits and use of language for unleashing meaningful impact and influence for the rest of their lives. They will build a personalized roadmap for their futures, while learning and applying frameworks, tools, and habits for high performance that positively influence family, business, and society at large.</p>",

For example, can nineteenth-century principles of scientific management still be identified in today's organizations? And if so, how? On a meso-level, the course explores the management and leadership practices within organizations. Students will use a cross-cultural lens to assess whether there is a best way to manage and lead within and across organizations and societies.

Since Milton Friedman's 1970 celebrated article \"The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase Its Profits\" the dominant story about capitalism has been centered around the \"Shareholder Value Maximization\" view. This view dichotomizes profit and purpose, conceptualizes business as a purely economic (and not social) institution, characterizes human beings as motivated by self-interest (and not values), and ultimately separates business and ethics. A new story of business has started to emerge that rejects all these false dichotomies and suggests we look at business as a human institution.

Energy, associated with fusion in the sun, radiation therapy, and nuclear energy is life-granting, in contrast to the destructive energy of nuclear bombs and nuclear disasters. This course examines the chemistry of the atomic nucleus and its technological applications and the processes that led to breakthroughs in the nuclear energy field, such as the first observation of nuclear reaction, the discovery of radioactivity, and nuclear fission. We also explore alternative forms of energy and renewable energy concepts, including aspects of energy storage and waste. Analyzing arguments for and against nuclear power plants, we assess the power and threat of nuclear weapons. We study international treaties designed to limit the spread of nuclear weapons, focusing on the challenges that policymakers and citizens face in guiding the use of nuclear power. This course helps students to think critically about the alternatives to nuclear energy and to what degree these alternative sources can provide the energy needed for the future.</p>",

How does gender shape our political identities, ways of thinking, and ways of acting, including how we act and interact within governance and state structures? How do social, cultural, economic, political, and historical dynamics in the context of the state produce gender arrangements and dynamics, as well as how does gender in this context intersect with other social identities, including race and ethnicity, class, nation, and sexualities. This course examines how gender, as a social category, shapes and is shaped by the state, political institutions, and governance processes from historical, contemporary, and global perspectives. It critically interrogates how the constitutional foundations, political institutions, and the formal and informal processes through which states operate are gendered.

How are racial designations constructed and how to they translate into different languages? We will address these and other questions using the Middle East region as a case study, drawing on literature from several disciplines - including anthropology, social and political science, history, geography, law, and philosophy - and applying theory to a range of empirical contexts. We begin with theoretical and historical questions that help make sense of the difference between race, racism, and racialization. Then, we trace how notions of race (such as jins and 'unsur) have been translated and understood in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). We will look closely at practices, policies and beliefs that designate racial terms in relation to power, biology, exclusion, and inclusion. Towards the end, we will consider recent social and political movements working to resist contemporary forms of bordering and closure.</p>",

More and more families are relying on migrant domestic workers to care for children and elderly dependents. But how does this care across borders impact the lives of the migrant domestic workers and their own kin? Who cares for the children these migrants leave behind in their home countries? Is sending financial remittances from overseas to support their left-behind families equivalent to being physically present in their children’s lives? Is the labor of caring for one’s family and other people’s families sufficiently valued (and remunerated) in the twenty-first century? How do migrant domestic workers engage in self- and community-care overseas? Students will explore these questions by engaging with feminist scholarship on migration, domestic work and care labor. Students will analyze the care policy regimes in the United Arab Emirates and Singapore to understand how migrant domestic workers engage in transnational carework in these countries and with their families back home, and how their carework is perceived and protected.

For more than a century, the cities of Jaffa and Tel Aviv have been at the center of a struggle over territory and identity. Tel Aviv, the first Hebrew city, embodies the secular modernity of the Zionist project. Conversely, neighboring Jaffa, the “Bride of Palestine,” is often portrayed as a quaint oriental quarter, a run-down district that turned into a hotspot for gentrification. However, the history of the two cities is inextricably linked: Tel Aviv was founded in 1909 as a Jewish suburb of Arab Jaffa only to conquer its mother city during the 1948 war and annex it. The two cities were made into one municipality: Tel Aviv-Jaffa. How is the hyphen between the cities made visible in everyday life? What are the limits of coexistence and when does violence break out?

Our neighborhoods are experiencing a collapse in everyday social interactions, sparking a debate about the decay of social life. Planners and designers criticize the excessive over-scaled urbanism seen in post-1990s developments, characterized by grand designs, fragmentation, vast expanses of glass and metal, and a loss of spontaneity within cities. In contrast to the traditional neighborhoods of the pre-1990s era, many new developments lack simplicity and dense physical layouts, which hampers neighborliness.

At the same time, besides the mystery of economic growth, there is the mystery of spatial inequality: why is inequality found at all spatial scales, from the international and regional to the urban and local? About 70% of the earth's land surface is inhabitable, but about 3% only is urban land, clearly indicating the staggering tendency of humans to cluster. The largest 681 metropolitan areas distributed over the globe house about 24% of the world's population but produce 60% of the global output. Spatial inequality is epitomized by the existence of cities that are characterized by high densities of activities and population. But why do people choose to live in big cities where they pay high rents and endure long commutes? Cities generally offer better amenities, as well as a wide range of local public goods. On top of that, firms in larger cities pay higher wages. But then, why would firms in big cities pay their employees these high wages? In sum, why do cities exist?</p><p>This course will be offered in January-Term 2025 in Abu Dhabi.</p>",

We will then apply these models to understand how health insurance markets work, the importance of externalities in health and health care, the interaction between markets for health and labor, and the role of government intervention in health care provision. We will also discuss key characteristics of current health care programs in the United States and elsewhere. Overall, this course will be a combination of discussion of important issues in health care, learning models that are helpful in explaining various aspects of health care and understanding what is known empirically. By the end of the course, students should be able to use economic reasoning to think critically about health-related policy issues.</p><p>Prerequisite: SOCSC-UH 1010Q, SOCSC-UH 1111</p>",

It operates through a price mechanism that disseminates information to decision-makers – firms, consumers, and regulators – and coordinates their behavior. When it works well, it promotes an efficient allocation of resources. But markets can suffer from several imperfections: some markets can be missing, as for most externalities; they can be incomplete, for example in the financial sector; agents can be price-makers or hide information, and therefore prevent competition from promoting efficiency. The course will review in depth most of the sources of market failures and their consequences.</p><p>Prerequisites: ECON-UH 2010 and, either MATH-UH 1021 or SOCSC-UH 1201</p>",

This course will review experimental evidence on the many mistakes and biases that humans fall prey to and look at evidence from psychology and neuroscience illustrating the origins of those mistakes. We will use that evidence to illustrate models of decision making arising from both economics and psychology (for example, expected utility theory vs. prospect theory, exponential discounting vs. hyperbolic discounting).

Why USD 1.90 a day? Where does this figure come from? How satisfactory is a definition of poverty that implies that there is practically no poor person in the United States or Europe today? Should poverty be measured with a pure monetary metric? How should the subjective and social aspect of poverty be taken into account? Alternative definitions often paint a much less optimistic landscape, with poverty diminishing much more slowly and in some cases not at all. More fundamentally, how is it the case that, even with the 1.90 USD a day definition, there still are countries today where about half the population is below that level?

This proposal outlines a novel experiment to investigate this question by delivering a short-form course, entitled Human + Machine: Applications in Mediated Reality, designed to foster and operationalize innovation through design thinking and technologies at the frontier of the recently possible. To the question above, combining the needs and strengths of both humans and technology to tackle a real business challenge is not only well-suited for today’s rapidly changing business and technology landscape, it is also an imperative for both institutions: the change-makers of the future must be comfortable at the intersection of business, technology, design and art - this is a foundational principle upon which NYU operates, and the opportunity to design a course to inspire students to innovate alongside industry is one that deserves exploration.</p>",

As of 2019, major economies (the EU, China, Japan, South Korea and the United States) have all announced their goals to reach climate neutrality mid-century. Political will combined with the rapidly declining production costs for clean technologies such as renewables and the electrification of transport are pushing the transition forward. Ironically, the transition to a low carbon economy has led to the creation of new global race over critical minerals, such as rare earths, lithium and cobalt and this competition has already given rise to a series of fresh global political and economic realities, tensions, and disputes. In this course, we will examine how major industrial powers are decarbonizing their economies and deploying their new green industrial strategies; the nature of contemporary resource competition.</p>",

Property was to be fundamentally rethought, along with the very concepts of race, gender, family, labor, and the common good. To get there, they insisted, humans themselves should be rebuilt. From the very first days, \"soft power\" was central to winning the war over hearts and minds. The masses would need supervision, and cinema played a leading role. In the words of Trotsky, cinema would become the government's new church. What was this vast social experiment and what are its legacies today? With a wide-ranging look at socialism on screen, this course introduces students to film theory and criticism, political economy, and creative approaches to egalitarian living.

While grassroots activity insists on the presence of the \"disappeared,\" cultural institutions, as well as families, can confront the complete loss of an archive. Recently, new laws have supported the establishment of numerous new memory organizations. Museums, artists, and activist groups have found routes to memorialization, through curating or making film; erecting topographies of memory in the physical landscape; building parks of memory at critical sites; and understanding \"Things as Bridges\" to social experience, e.g. memory and history as graspable through encounters with objects.

Different formal choices will lead to entirely new set of explorations and meanings embedded in the same theme. This course attempts to blur boundaries between documentary and narrative film, conceptual and emotive cinema, art and communication. Students are encouraged to reflect on 'what' they want to express and 'how' they intend to express this. But the key motivation for the assignments is to lead students to addressing the question - 'why'. Why am I making this image and what is my relationship with and responsibility towards this image - this is the core concern that students will grapple with. Students are encouraged to locate their research question within Abu Dhabi or the UAE.</p><p>Prerequisite: FILMM-UH 2510 or FILMM-UH 1912</p>",

It has been a great success that has developed powerful Nobel prize-winning theories that are quite consistent with observation â€“ contributions such as portfolio theory, option-pricing, valuation, agency and signaling among others. These contributions have gone on to revolutionize the practice of both investment and corporate finance. However, there remain many anomalies that these traditional models struggle to explain; such as, various anomalies in the price of assets (e.g., why low P/E firms outperform the high ones), the wide swings in stock prices â€“ say relative to the more stable dividends shareholders receive, and why managers attempt to keep earnings stable through Earnings Per Share (EPS) manipulation. The field of Behavioral Finance has put forth explanations for these anomalies and others by relaxing the assumption of the completely rational, disciplined and selfish human. In this course, we define the traditional finance's decision-maker as having three traits: (1) he is only interested in maximizing his own welfare; (2) his models for determining his utility as a function of his actions follow perfect mathematical logic; and (3) the cool, calm and collected decision-maker takes actions without emotional bias. We will find that there are substantial violations of each of these. What behavioral economists call bounded self-interest, bounded rationality and bounded will-power. Thus, humans being aware of them can help themselves in their everyday life as well as in finance, and that they might shed light on some of the anomalies that Traditional Finance have had a hard time explaining.</p>",

With Arabian and Islamic identity as its focus, this class explores how the transnationalism of heritage connects cultures and subcultures as shared heritage, but at other times, heritage is a source of conflict and contestation, as is the case with several memorial and archaeological sites and art and artisan expressions of collective memory.

Rigorous global history questions and even supplants common understandings of globalization as Westernization. But how does history do this, and can a global historical framework enhance all forms of historical, humanistic, and social scientific inquiry? Following an assessment of foundational modern Western frameworks for understanding world history, including those of Marx and Hegel, students examine how and why people around the world have variously embraced and rejected such foundational accounts. Readings address all world regions, including Asia, Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Oceania, and familiarize students with state-of-the-art knowledge about globalization. <br>NOTE: This course maybe used in place of SOCSC-UH 1011 (GEPS) for Social Science Majors or Minors.</p>",

The standard view of Asia as being a static collection of fixed bounded territories, cut off from Europe, Middle East, Africa, and America, and propelled by Europeans into modernity, is dangerously archaic.

It is hailed as the crime of crimes and all states, regardless of their ratification status, are legally bound to prevent and prosecute genocide. Yet genocide not only continues to proliferate in international society, it has also proven a politically useful term of legitimation evidence by its invocation to justify wars, in issues of state sovereignty and territoriality and in questions of reparations to post-colonial states. This class poses and tries to answer the following: How and why did armed conflict and violence against civilians occur? How are war and genocide related? How, if at all, does localized violence relate to broader processes like state decomposition, formation, and consolidation? Or is racial hatred really the main factor?  How were the categories of civilians, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide constructed in the history of the law of armed conflict (\"international humanitarian law\")?

This course will debate answers to these questions by exploring how gender systems, mediated by power relations of class, race, religion, nationality, and sexuality, shaped women’s lived experiences in different times and places from 1500 to the present. We will seek the clues to these systems by studying a variety of sources created both by and about women from religion, politics, philosophy, law, science and medicine, and public and popular culture. We will study how ideas about gender traveled, adapted, and sometimes changed through case studies of cross-cultural encounters, empire-building, revolutions, social movements, and economic and technological transformations. And we will evaluate how the rich diversity of women’s lives in our collective past, judged by their legal status, family lives, work, and public roles, accommodated or contested these gender norms and expectations.

During the first part of the course, students formulate questions about the ethics of modern humanitarianism by exploring scholarly works by anthropologists, political scientists, and sociologists, as well as films and literary texts. Students then use these questions to review historical case-studies, from the abolition of the slave trade to the #Kony2012 campaign.

So, one of our chief questions will revolve around the fact that the Romans were so successful elsewhere, yet, for the most part, failed in their imperial project here. Can this be explained in terms of their imperial project writ large? There is, to my knowledge, no scholarly literature dealing with this question specifically, and as a whole.

The course introduces students to the origins and evolution of civilization and human thought and traces how the world became increasingly integrated and connected - economically, politically, militarily and socially, and what that means for how the world works today. The course begins by asking what we might mean by 'global history,' and then considers global phenomena including empire, slavery, colonialism and revolution, through primary and secondary sources. We will explore how and where that past interacts with the present. In the course an emphasis is placed on understanding different historical contexts and points of view through the use of primary sources, and on identifying and evaluating moments of cross-cultural interaction within world history.

How might a close examination of falconry help explain the emergence and transformation of social categories such as nobility and poverty, male and female, believer and pagan, citizen and foreigner? How might it require us to confront human fragility - our bodily, intellectual, and spiritual limits, our experiences of joy, love, youth, death, faith, science, and more?

Similarly, accessible data, mobile computing, and technologies that combine aspects of the real and virtual worlds are making it more difficult for humans to maintain our orientation within geo-physical space. This course examines the fundamental and advanced technological aspects of digital body reconstruction in relation to human interaction. Students learn from a variety of sources such as hybrid identities, posthuman embodiment, and artistic interpretations of the cyborg to learn how to adapt and alter human body representations in mixed reality. The class uses a variety of techniques in narrative, cinematic, interactive, sculptural, and performative approaches to explore conceptual topics by examining motions that both mimic and transcend the boundaries of reality. Topics include human-computer interaction and user experience, design principles, storytelling, and mixed reality development (virtual, augmented, and extended reality).</p><p>Prerequisites: IM-UH 1010, IM-UH 1011, IM-UH 2310, IM-UH 2318, IM-UH 3310, IM-UH 3311, CS-UH 1001 or ENGR-UH 1000</p>",

This course works from the assumption that these three questions can no longer be separated from one another. We draw from recent work in ethnography that shows the everyday reality of Islamic law, in addition to texts in politics, history, and comparative legal theory. We will interrogate dimensions of secularism, sovereignty, and political authority as they intersect with the daily lives of contemporary Muslims in Malaysia, Egypt, Britain and elsewhere. The course begins with a brief, foundational introduction to Islamic law, then proceeds to study the impact of European colonialism in the Middle East and South Asia, the apostasy case against Nasr Abu Zayd, Imam Khomeini's fatwas on sex reassignment, and several cases of religious conversion; the course concludes with studies of how Muslims navigate the landscape of legal pluralism in contemporary Europe.</p>",

However, if urban growth is managed properly, cities also have the potential to be efficient and sustainable users of natural resources, especially in this era of advanced technology that allows for remote monitoring and control of resource use. Recognizing the challenges that cities face and their potential, one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals is to \"make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable\" by 2030. This seminar will analyze innovative sustainability policies implemented in leading cities around the world and examine the opportunities - and potential drawbacks - to allowing global cities to play an increasingly significant role in environmental regulation.

Moving between Switzerland and Turkey and the south of France, Baldwin called himself a \"transatlantic commuter.\" This course explores Baldwin's writing across the genres of essays, fiction, plays, poems, and even children's literature to consider what his \"global imagination\" has to teach us about what it meant to live then, and now, as global citizens in an increasingly interconnected world. We will treat New York City as both a literary space explored in Baldwin's work and a space of our own first-hand inquiry. In addition to visiting Baldwin's homes in Harlem and Greenwich Village, students will have a special opportunity to spend time researching their final projects in the \"James Baldwin Papers\" archive at the NY Public Library's Schomburg Center for the Study of Black Culture in Harlem. As they work on these projects, students will also have the chance to meet and learn from editors, archivists, scholars, and book designers who produced a recent new edition of Baldwin's previously out-of-print book, Little Man, Little Man: A Story of Childhood.</p>",

Using a variety of genres, we will examine the impact on global cities of war, gender and social inequality, populism, migration and climate change. We will consider issues of local politics and urban planning as they are reflected in official and unofficial narratives of city life.

    "title": "Politics Of Writing",
    "description": "<p>The central question animating this course is how writing shapes the world. Throughout history, writing has had an ambiguous status. For instance, in Plato’s Republic - an iconic philosophical treatise in western thought - he wishes to banish poets. Plato felt writers were dangerous - that they could misrepresent 'reality' and be politically and socially destabilizing. Writing, therefore, has historically been a site of tension, with those in power fascinated by its potential but also wary of its subversiveness. These tensions that characterize writing - a productive tool but at the same time a potentially destabilizing force - has meant that writers throughout history and from vastly differing contexts have reflected on the act of writing. In this course we will explore how writing is put to different uses and the power of the written word to mold reality. We will ask a series of interrelated questions: Are aesthetic choices also political? Is there a politics to the languages we chose? What can we infer from the context within which writing takes place? Is there a politics to literary-form? Can writing perpetuate existing inequalities, and if so, can it just as well ameliorate them?</p>",

Do we assume, for instance, the existence of an essential \"female\" way of writing, shared by women across time and geography? Drawing on both literary and critical materials, students will also consider the complexities and challenges of reading across literary tradition(s) and the ways in which writing from multiple historical and cultural situations represents intersections of gender, race, class, nation, and sexuality.

Roman law required confession, often forced, to legitimize the legal process. Foucault claims the West relies on confession for the production of truth. Do expressions of the shameful in the lyric essay work similarly to legitimate the writer? Perhaps we doubt we have the authority to claim a reader’s sympathy unless we are performing self-abasement – or perhaps confession allows our audiences access to experiences of self-identification and relief as they confront shames of their own while reading. In an age of post-colonial guilt and racial melancholy, of persisting gender injustice and hostility to neurodiversity, might confession provide a way to address structural problematics that Western modernity seems founded upon? How can the act of confessing help writers to reclaim the power of shamelessness, reconfiguring social expectations along the way? What of allyship and the burden readers bear in “hearing” a confession? In this course, we will read across cultures and produce creative nonfiction writing that diversely embodies the confessional.</p>",

Revolutions always reveal the contradictions built into capitalist modernity, and by reading their movements across borders, we begin to understand not only the dimensions of political change but also the possibilities of social change.

It is an entirely different activity, however, to write a poem that is attuned to the ears of a particular community or poetic tradition or a poem that takes inspiration from multiple traditions to convey innovative ways of seeing, feeling, and perceiving the world around us. Similar to the way we learn a language by conversing with people who actively use that language, in order to learn the ways that poetry is written today, we must read the work of contemporary poets. Even if we don’t foresee a lifetime of writing poems, being able to explain to oneself and others how and why language might be used to express the inexpressible is an essential skill for anyone interested in effective communication. In this course, we will read poetry books published within the last five years, and we will encounter them all for the first time together. This is to prioritize process over outcome as we write and interpret poems. The point is not merely to praise or to criticize poems, but to investigate what makes them work, to demystify the writing process, and to understand how living poets adapt the ancient practice of crafting language into art for a new generation.</p><p>Prerequisite: LITCW-UH 1003 or approval by the instructor.</p>",

That is the very challenge which this course is designed to address. How to incorporate into the short feature's abbreviated space all the same elements of a long feature: voice, point-of-view, character, drama, dialogue, scenes. In his famous sonnet Nuns Fret Not at Their Convent's Narrow Room, William Wordsworth underscores the various ways in which the strictures of the sonnet - a mere14 lines ruled by a set meter and rhyme scheme - compel a writer to more ardently and imaginatively fly the very confines of the form, and thus arrive at places they might not have otherwise. This same dynamic informs the many published short features we'll be reading and discussing in this class, and will, of course, come into play in the writing of the three roughly 1,000-word short features that students will be asked to compose.</p>",

    "description": "<p>For the poet Aimé Cesaire, from the tiny island of Martinique, there was the master narrative of the middle passage, that brought African slaves to the Americas; there was the movement of labor and capital that circled the Caribbean in slavery's aftermath; and there was the circulation of ideas that produced the radical collages of surrealism. This course examines a range of narratives of flight - that of the refugee, the immigrant, the exile, the migrant worker - in fiction, poetry, film, theater, painting and music. It also examines critical theories of migration on refugeeism, displacement, and immigration, in order to ask: How does \"flight\" produce new aesthetic forms? How have scholars theorized the range of concepts and problems engendered by such movement? Along the way, we will read about Iraqi refugees, Vietnamese \"boat people\", Indian painters, the Jewish dispossessed of World War II. Towards the end of the term, we use this theoretical vocabulary to consider the ocean still to cross (une mer encore à traverser) in relation to two contemporary crises: flight across the Mediterranean and the refugeed Rohingya of Myanmar.</p>",

    "description": "<p>How do works of literature capture, hold, and train our attention? We live in a time when attention and attention disorders have captured both the scientific and the popular imagination. Turning their \"attention to attention,\" like never before, scientists are identifying the rich variety of attentional modes our brain is capable of, as well as a contemporary addiction to, \"narrow-focus attention.\" This course plumbs the rich offerings of literature describing a wide spectrum of attentional modes, as well as training, enriching and potentially even healing its reader's attention. Indeed, long before modern science, modernist literature excelled at both describing human attention and complexly engaging it through its novel experiments. Modernism has long been seen as a Western European interwar phenomenon, with current scholarship vigorously expanding our understanding of these limits. This course will include close examinations of some best-known Western European classics, but will also explore some of the long-overlooked origins, expressions, and subsequent migrations of modernism elsewhere, from Europe's Eastern margins, to the Harlem Renaissance and modern Chinese literature.</p>",

The following issues will be tackled: how do novelists translate the changes of their cultures into literary form? What literary traditions do they draw on? How do these reflect the different movements in Islam, and the other religions of the region? What kinds of worldly and personal representations emerge? How have these been changing recently, notably since the Arab Revolutions? How different are novels written in English or French for a global audience from those written in Arabic?

This course considers the various registers of postcolonial freedom and the aesthetic forms they take, from the Caribbean surrealists, agitating against French colonialism, and articulating an aesthetics of negritude, to expatriate South Asian artists in Paris, who find new forms of freedom in abstractionist painting. The Dalit Panthers, modeled on the Black Panthers of America, articulated an anti-caste radicalism in the context of newly liberated India, while African writers from Nigeria to Kenya wrestled with the alienating English of the British empire, and the new languages of Independence. This course uses the dialectic of alienation and freedom, of anguish and exaltation, to think through the range of aesthetic forms that freedom takes: political, social, existential, while also interrogating the nature of caste, race, and gender-based forms of alienation. In doing so, we read some of the key figures that have shaped postcolonial modernities: Albert Camus and Franz Fanon, Simone de Beauvoir and B.R. Ambedkar, Aime Cesaire and Derek Walcott.</p>",

There is often little historical or political context this coverage. Even with the Internet and global access to African journalism, the stereotypical portraits of a 'dark continent' persists. But in recent years, a cadre of African writers have begun to change that narrative. These writers, worldly and comfortable on global streets, have churned out works that center a nuanced portrait of contemporary life in African cities today. They have been able to have some success in their literature in ways that contemporary journalism from this region has never been able to.

Tech is no longer a vertical and now requires workers to be well versed in how to develop, create and manage technology either as a business or a key element thereof. The modern approach to technology development and management arose out of entrepreneurial technology ventures which are now some of the largest companies in the world. Even at scale, those companies are still nimble and innovative -- let alone the next generation of them which are constantly emerging. This, plus the fact that technology is now in now important in every industry, has incumbents scrambling to be competitive. One way they are doing this is hiring people with technology experience. However, they are also re-organizing into product-customer centric iterative and experimental technology organizations. There has never been more competition for tech workers. In the 21st century organization -- learning from tech companies -- the key roles revolve around engineering (software & hardware), design, data science and product management. Of the four, the first three have advanced academic program but the last, product management, has no academic offering meaning workers must gain knowledge and experience on the job. The trap is that most PM jobs require experience. Those trying to break into a tech role as a PM cannot easily gain that.

Regular projects in directed composition and analysis provide hands-on engagement with theoretical concepts, while frequent reading and listening assignments place techniques in historical context, introducing significant composers and performers. Weekly lab sections are devoted to skills in musicianship: listening, sight-singing, dictation, and basic keyboard skills.</p>",

As a music of the Indian Ocean civilizations trade, it is also extra-Khaleeji and extra-Arabic. It changed with each pearling and trading season as sailors and divers played music with the locals as they waited for monsoon winds to change direction before sailing home, eager to share the new sounds and instruments upon their return. What happens to this tradition as it is appropriated into the realm of heritage performance as static national-capital?

These are powerful musical traditions caught in the crosshairs of colonial collaboration and coercion. The aim of the course is to move beyond critical commentary on this tragic history alone, and offer regenerative insight into the workings of pre-colonial African ideas. Amadinda music, for example, offers a mode of patterning both pitch and time that challenges the global-hegemonic organizational principles of musical temporality and tonality. These modes of patterning and time-reckoning offer alternatives to cultural practices of time and timing in the West; and ultimately cast a critical light on Newtonian temporality itself. We will investigate the history of time-reckoning in relation to these pre-colonial temporal practices.</p><p>This course includes a regional academic seminar to South Africa.

Radical changes in the historical conditions of death have resonated far beyond the battlefield, shaping fundamental questions about the meaning of the self, time, and history. How has opera registered these changes and participated in these shifts? Can musical work like an opera provide a map for examining uncharted places beyond the thresholds of human experience?

Each part spans four weeks: three weeks of case studies, followed by a Reflection Forum for sharing and receiving feedback on assignments. Our exploration will be guided by three overarching questions: In what ways have women engaged with song as a vehicle for individual and collective expression? How does a global approach enrich our understanding of what song can be and do? And what are the opportunities and challenges of developing a revisionist history of song through the case studies explored here? Our approach will be informed by perspectives from history, cultural studies, and gender studies, alongside practical exploration of women’s voices across styles and genres: from the German Lied, through the Chilean Nueva Canción (“New Song”) movement, to iconic singer-songwriters in the Arab world. This will lead to a multilayered picture of women’s contributions to song through the ages and across the globe. This course focuses on the art and practice of singing. Through a framework of practical approaches (individual instruction and ensemble practice labs), and weekly lectures, students will explore the practical and theoretical evolution of vocal repertoire and performance in relation to their own vocal development.

Understanding the historical situation and its normative context, especially treating the Other as a dhimmi, may help transfer those experiences when Christians, Jews and Muslims found a way to live in relative peace, with respect and interchange present at several levels. Abu Dhabi itself recently discovered evidence of this type of communality between Muslims and Christians.

The process of defining the national community is usually contested and often leads to violence. In many societies, this process is still ongoing. In this class, we will examine the process of post-colonial nation building through the prism of a fascinating and topical case-study, that of contemporary Ukraine. Ukraine continues to struggle to define itself visa-á-vis its former imperial neighbor Russia. In examining the Ukrainian case study, we will ask what a nation is in the world, how political identities are created and how they take root, and what role the institutions and culture play in the persistence of durable national identities. Students will gain a deeper understanding of the concept of nationalism, the forces and processes behind the construction of durable national identities, and a chance to engage with cutting edge methodological questions.</p>",

Some philosophers have provided disheartening answers: life is suffering, and then it ends; life is absurd and never gains any meaning. But other philosophers have provided more uplifting answers that support the quest for personal significance. Bot h kinds of answers deserve scrutiny. After reviewing various pessimistic and more optimistic approaches to the meaning of life, we will turn to the subject of death. We will all die eventually. We normally encounter the death of our family and friend s before we must deal with our own. These themes too are the subject of philosophical reflection.

Is it rational to believe that our best scientific theories are even approximately true? What justifies the claim that different types of evidence lend varying degrees of support to a particular theory, or that a single piece of evidence supports one theory more than another? Similarly, it is often claimed that scientific theories provide us with \"real\" explanations of physical phenomena, whereas other theories aren't \"genuinely explanatory.\" To what extent is this true?

What does it take for something to count as a mathematical \"proof\"? We consider some surprising mathematical results, including Godel's incompleteness theorems, multiple sizes of infinity, and the status of the continuum hypothesis, and examine their philosophical significance.

What has been called “the sport of the kings” and has been part of royal education for centuries globally, aims to create a transformation of both the trainee (the falcon) and the trainer (the falconer). Both entities are required to modify their instinctual behavior, learning to transform their “natural” instincts to an end that is still connected to their nature, but far superior. This requires us to constantly refine, hand in hand, both our intellectual faculties and our physical abilities. Drawing on fitness including nutrition, stress management, and physical fitness from a holistic and natural approach, this course explores one of the world’s oldest art of self-training our mind and our body in connection with the world that surrounds us.

The course thus offers students a chance to analyze at the macro-scale the complex global challenges the world faces in the decades to come, while at the same training students to see how to ‘read’ power in apparently apolitical contexts. The course unfolds in two sections. In the first section, students will engage with the foundations of International Relations as a discipline, affording an opportunity to investigate the regional politics of the UAE and the Middle East as well as global issues by way of a variety of theoretical perspectives. The course's second section, which begins in Jordan, focuses on the ‘lived experience’ of international politics, inviting students to explore how politics manifests in diverse contexts ranging from airports, to shopping malls, to cultural heritage sites.

The class will study the role of media in ensuring a well-informed citizenry and improving government accountability through elections and collective action. It will then focus on institutional and personal constraints that hinder the ability of media to fulfill these goals. In particular, this class will cover media slant, censorship, fake news, and polarization on the institutional side, and motivated reasoning, correlational neglect, and selective exposure on the personal side. The readings are meant to familiarize students with classical and recent research on media and politics, as well as raising issues of relevance.

The “Dirty War” (1976-1983) still marks its institutions; its impact of censorship and human destruction still shape the daily work of archivists. While grassroots activity insists on the presence of the “disappeared,” cultural institutions, as well as families, can confront the complete loss of an archive. Recently, new laws have supported the establishment of numerous new memory organizations.  Museums, artists, and activist groups have found routes to memorialization, through curating or making film; erecting topographies of memory in the physical landscape; building parks of memory at critical sites; and understanding “Things as Bridges” to social experience e.g. memory and history as graspable through encounters with objects.

For the first half of the course, students will explore a different theoretical question relating to international migration each week e.g. Why do people leave their home countries? Who actually makes the migration decision? Through these questions, students will explore the role played by individual-level factors, households, networks, industry actors, and governments in shaping the migration processes. During the second half of the course, students will be exposed to questions about the post-migration experience and migrants’ impacts on their sending and receiving countries/communities. The literature on select categories of migrants (e.g. trafficking victims, refugees/asylum seekers, undocumented migrants, highly skilled migrants, lifestyle migrants, etc.) will also be introduced to students, giving them an opportunity to understand the specific issues faced by each migrant sub-population pre- and post-migration.</p>",

Under what conditions are immorality and evil more likely? The sociology of morality investigates people's moral understandings, moral and immoral behavior, and societies' moral institutions and norms. Unlike philosophers and ethicists, sociologists don't try to answer moral questions. Rather, they conduct empirical research about individuals', groups', and societies' morals. This class has a reading-and-analysis component and a hands-on research component.

Also, we shall scrutinize the societal challenges brought about by these developments, such as the economic hardships of young couples, the erosion of \"traditional\" support networks for elderly and diseased persons, and the \"neo-liberalization\" of marriage. Finally, we shall take a close look at the various ways in which contemporary Arab men and women define, negotiate, and legitimate their gender identities by drawing on Islamic values, traditional ideas and practices as well as national and transnational discourses.</p>",

Scholars are recognizing the important role sports plays in people's individual and social lives and the way sports provides a venue where debates and conflicts are played out. Researchers, NGOs and governments are using sports to build relationships among individuals from different groups in an attempt to foster understanding, empathy and cooperation. At the same time, researchers are beginning to use sports data to test social science theories. The rapid growth in computing resources combined with readily available performance and event data has resulted in a burst of work across fields such as political science, sociology, economics and psychology. In part 1, we use a variety of case studies to explore how sports can offer a lens through which to study society and, more specifically, politics. Part 2 puts sports data to use in testing social science theories of identity, trust, and prejudice, among others. Our focus will be on how sports is used to bridge ethnic and religious divides and the role of sports in building understanding between traditionally rival groups in Israel and Palestine.

On the one hand, there is the expectation that the vestiges of a post-Enlightenment heritage will offer these developed societies the framework to construct a truly egalitarian social and economic order. At the same time, we are trained theoretically to confront the inevitability of stratification, especially in societies motivated by capitalism. In turn, this brings us to an academic dilemma that rests at the very cornerstone of evolved meritocracies: if stratification is inevitable, then is inequality acceptable so long as it is \"fairly\" achieved? This \"fair\" justification for inequality is pervasive and most easily accepted: and in turn, problematic. Because so much of current inequality in society can be justified, most social processes do not seem extreme or blatantly unequal until it is too late. But whether or not we recognize these individual micro-processes, inequality and stratification in the developed first world is both extreme and rising.</p>",

In this course, students will learn the process of human-centered, systems design and gain familiarity with integrative tools to tackle complex organizational or societal challenges toward positive impact. Students will reflect on what is a “challenge” and what it means to have “impact” and internalize theory, methods, and processes for human-centered, systems thinking and design. To apply theory to practice, students will be put into teams to undergo a design process to identify a problem and design an initiative, policy intervention, program, product, or enterprise for impact at the local organizational or community level.

    "description": "<p>The cost of genotyping is dropping faster than Moore's law is bringing down the price of computing power. As a result, genetic data is pouring into social scientific studies, raising old debates about genes and IQ, racial differences, criminal justice, political polarization and privacy. As it turns out, serious analysis of genes and society often yields counter-intuitive results. For example, genes matter for IQ and social class, but they often act as an engine of social mobility thanks to the mixing up that takes place through recombination. Meanwhile, genetic analysis does not reify folk racial categories but challenges them: Due to a population bottleneck coming out of Africa, a Caucasian is probably more genetically similar to Inuit than are two Ugandans 200 miles apart. This course explores this new field of sociogenomics - what the genome tells us about our collective past, present society and what the future holds in terms of genetic prediction. Abu Dhabi is an ideal site: it is a cosmopolitan hub that draws diverse immigrants; the Arabian Peninsula was the site of the great population bottleneck; and the UAE has a high rate of first-cousin marriage.</p>",

How do these top-down empowerment initiatives influence the day-to-day lives of women and men in the GCC? What kinds of femininities and masculinities are reshaped and negotiated in response to these programs? How do the practices and discourses of \"state feminism\" and \"global competitiveness\" simultaneously strengthen and obscure important aspects of gender equality?

What constitutes the \"event\" is broad: set designs can be created for dance performances; narrative plays; nonlinear plays; performance art; exhibition design, fashion and opera and other music events, etc. Focusses throughout the semester will be on the consideration of theatrical time, composition, and the process of manifesting conceptual or theatrical ideas visually and spatially. How do spaces progress in time with the performative and textual demands of the piece? How does composition express visual and conceptual ideas? What are the relationships between an originating text or prompt and its visual/spatial manifestation? How does a scenic design manifest the core ideas of a production while still offering space for the multiple layers of the actors and work of other creative design disciplines? What is the basis for these choices?</p>",

Students analyze their body and movement with four different kinds of mask: Neutral mask, Larval mask, Commedia dell'Arte mask and the smallest mask in the world, the red nose of the clown. In this process, the disguise drives the students to discover emotions, movements and thoughts far from their habitual and comfortable modes; by gradually removing the disguise, they reach self-awareness and learn how to enjoy their presence on stage. Combining the methodologies of Jacques Lecoq, Carlo Boso and Philippe Gaulier the course guides students through analysis of stage performance and its effects.</p>",

Framing dramaturgy as the consideration of structural aesthetics and their impact, we’ll investigate a range of dramaturgical approaches for collaboration, space, and performance. We will look at dramaturgies across art forms and geographies and land them in theater practice. Texts include The Upanishads; works by Hijikata and Lorca as juxtaposed with innovative performances by Pina Bausch and Kazuo Ohno; the work of Björk, FKA Twigs, Sevdaliza, Diamanda Galás, and Arca; the paintings of Frida Kahlo; the films of David Lynch, Alejandro Jodorowsky, and Matthew Barney. We will also consider cultural innovators such as Theaster Gates, Ai Weiwei, Marina Abramović, and Yoko Ono. The course engages students in a detailed approach of Theater Mitu's research/training methodology of Whole Theater.

Sociological investigations: how clothes 'perform' on bodies in the present and past; why people wear what they wear; correlations to larger global phenomena (the fashion system, social media, history of regional and vernacular communities) will be key in designing costumes for real and fictionalized characters. Through theoretical projects, students will begin a design process, going through a sequence of steps: dramaturgical analysis, gathering pictorial and relevant research; engaging creative imagination, and visualizing designs through sketching and collage to create a concrete presentation of designs, ideas, transformations. Projects will include text-based drama, opera, dance and performance art. Emphasis is on experimentation, creativity and collaborative process within a creative team.

In this module, the class will explore a gamut of idioms used to create narrative in contemporary dance (while also looking at highly expressive classical forms like kathak). Students will create ekphrastic work in the medium of their choice (dance, performance, writing…), drawing from existing recommended pieces of dance or text.

Cultural producers - theatre and film-makers, singers, graffiti artists, and performance activists - supported the uprisings in public spaces and online. As a result, the Arab public sphere and art-making has been transformed: the boundaries of permissible speech were breached; state sanctioned venues were undermined as art-makers turned to informal venues, city spaces, and the digital public sphere. This work repeated demands for popular sovereignty - the right of the people to invalidate corrupt rule - evidenced in the rallying cry “Ash-shaʻb yurīd isqāṭ an-niẓām” (the people demand the Regime’s downfall) whether chanted in public squares, painted on walls, or incorporated into performance pieces. Increasingly, artistic work in the shadow of uprisings has explored the personal decisions informing individual revolts, decisions that not only involve resistance to political elites but family, religious, and social elites. As such, the ongoing art of the uprisings erases boundaries between the personal and political. This art expands on artist attacks on patriarchy and demands for sexual freedom that gained intensity in the Arab World at the turn of this century and continue today.</p>",

This question drives the “social turn” in art and privileges collaborations between artists and per formers who act in the role of instigators or catalysts with the communities around them. Rejecting the artist’s traditional role as the producer of a consumable aesthetic object or theatrical performance, the social practice of art and performance proposes that collaborative engagements-activist, participatory, coauthored-must be understood and valued as art. Cooperative processes become frameworks and methodologies to understand, explore and shift the impact of political and social policy, architecture, art and performance history, urban planning, and new media. The social practice of art and performance makes encounters between members of a community who are valued as “expert participants,” and trained artists. Through social cooperation and aesthetic practice, the hope in this project is that we might construct more livable lives.

What makes art practice such a fertile ground for this to happen on? When and where did this tradition begin? Self-reflection, self-portraiture and memoir allow us to talk about personal loss, a beautiful memory, pain or a pressing desire to forgive. It's an art practice that thrives on uncertainty and in turn, a curiosity, that encourages us to look inside for answers. This course examines the history of self-reflective art in the forms of written, visual and performative autobiography and memoir. Students engage with texts written by those who study and research in this field. They will 'read' and analyze artifacts produced by those who use art-making to process and understand 'the self.' By imagining and making their own work, students explore first-hand how art mediates the sometimes disquieting but also joyful and transformative moments in our life. Students will reflect aspects of themselves in a final Portfolio of Self Reflection that requires they work in different artistic mediums.</p>",

It explores different approaches to memorialization, and considers how to strike an appropriate balance between the desire to showcase \"golden ages\" and the responsibility to restore silenced voices. Beginning in Abu Dhabi, both sections will meet together to discuss global cultural heritage, before visiting the Louvre Abu Dhabi. The two sections then embark upon their own individual journeys. \"The Quill and the Chisel\" visits Florence, where students examine Michelangelo Buonnarroti’s unparalleled influence on Renaissance architecture, art, poetry, and sculpture. In considering Michelangelo’s remarkable artistic and literary achievements, alongside those featured at the Louvre Abu Dhabi, it asks students to weigh their importance in Florentine, Renaissance, and Global history. \"Histories of - and in - Greece\" considers the place of suppressed Byzantine, Ottoman, Jewish, and refugee histories within “Greek history” through an exploration of a diverse group of Athenian landmarks. In doing so, it challenges students to establish criteria for determining whether these sites and their attached histories have a larger significance, \"outstanding universal value,\" and \"importance to the collective interests of humanity.\" Through the use of social media, students will collaborate extensively between the two locations to further interrogate the question of how history and memory are produced. Upon returning to Abu Dhabi, groups comprised of students from both sections will craft presentations synthesizing their on-site research, in an effort to address the questions posed at the start of the course.

How do texts “imagine” geographies? This FYWS takes up a variety of fiction and non-fiction texts in order to investigate how space and national and/or personal identity is imagined. Students will investigate how texts open a space for readers to imagine unknown worlds and geographies. Readings include essays, short stories, and poems that all attempt to capture an experience of self in relation to a locale.

To complicate matters further, what tends to pass as informed commentary on Islam often turns out to be colored by competing agendas, experiences, and narratives. With these challenges in mind, this FYWS focuses on contemporary debates about the history, society, and culture of Islam. The course begins by grappling with contesting representations of Islam by Bernard Lewis, Edward Said, Robert Spencer, and Samuel Huntington. It then delves into some prominent sites of conflict and tension brought to the fore by such events as the Charlie Hebdo affair and the burqa controversy as well as the rise in Islamophobia in Europe.

What makes a movie about a drug addicted professional wrestler more a story about love than the violence inherent his life? How does a beautiful painting or song make us cry? Art flourishes in a world of opposites and contradictions. Art is reflective and provocative, reactionary and thoughtful, private and public. As one of our oldest methods of documenting what we see, it also reconfigures and transforms what we imagine. This freshman writing seminar will serve as an introduction to these tensions, and the social, political and material roles that art plays in our life. It will familiarize you with academic writing, and further develop your critical reading, thinking and writing skills. It will draw from a range of art forms that explore both current social issues, and more enduring questions.<br>The course texts cover a wide range of artistic culture and practice: from Paleolithic cave painting and sculpture, to contemporary mural painting – including the work of Harring, Rivera, Fazlalizadeh, Banksy, and Zabou. Readings will explore the relationship between art and nature. The paradox of tragic beauty is exemplified in short stories, films, plays, and in the work of Frieda Kahlo, Odd Nerdrum, Evelyn de Morgan, and Sue Coe. Joe Sacco’s, Palestine highlights the inevitable ties that art has to politics and society, and provides an entre into another twofold idea: conflict and resolution. Crucially, they will help facilitate the discussions, writing assignments and oral presentations in the class.<br>Our first paper responds to only one of the written or visual texts examined in the first few weeks of class. By crafting an argument around a close and careful reading of the chosen text the writer learns how to read as a writer, and to formulate an interesting, arguable thesis. Paper two engages with several texts and the form of those texts will vary. An essay, a film and play, for example, provide ideal material for a fascinating textual dialogue. Finally, the oral presentation in advance of the last paper will help organize and outline the final written assignment, a longer, argument based research paper, on a debate or controversy in the art world.

Other writers regard its universal aspirations as a “threat” to “Western” values. Still others remain skeptical that the Shari‘a was ever meant to be universal. Without answering the question of whether it is, was, or should be “universal,” this writing course investigates the debates that the question has inspired. How do different writers perceive the universality of Shari‘a? What are the political, ethical, or other stakes of arguments about Shari‘a’s universality? Readings connect theoretical approaches to individual case studies in milieus as diverse as shari‘a courts in Ottoman Turkey, fatwa councils in contemporary Egypt, and divorce proceedings in Iran. Through creative and critical writing assignments, students explore the contexts, motives, and forms of evidence brought to bear by authors who contribute to ongoing debates about the ways we understand Shari‘a today.</p><p>Prerequisite: Must be a first-year Abu Dhabi student.</p>",

This FYWS sets out to discover why outsiders are both essential and potentially dangerous. The figure of “the outsider” is often clueless - or in over his head - or ignorant. But ignorance can be liberating, fostering open-mindedness and a chance to weave complexity back into dead narratives. Crucially, analyzing the role of the outsider across a range of texts and cultures will help us question the act of belonging. Biss’s Notes from No Man’s Land will aid in our investigation, as will essays by Binyavanga Wainaina and Suketu Mehta. In order to understand outsiders with adopted countries the course will consider Katherine Boo’s book about Mumbai’s destitute, Behind the Beautiful Forevers. Documentaries by Mads Brugger and Joshua Oppenheimer help explore how “the outsider” is sometimes seen as a master manipulator and exploiter.

The recent rise in smartphone technology and social media networks raises old and new questions about how photography alters the way we see and know the world, including important ethical questions about the medium’s intrusive and seductive nature. Drawing on the writings of Sontag, Sischy, Said and others, this FYWS analyzes photography’s power in shaping our collective consciousness, but also the limitations on capturing reality. Beginning with a fundamental division between \"art\" and \"documentary\" photography, students will delve into the ethics and aesthetics of portraying pain, tragedy, and death.

This Writing Seminar invites students into a close and careful examination of the written, oral and visual representations of the American West in order to analyze and explore the mythologies that contribute to a national identity. <br>These representations are often set against a backdrop of unimaginable physical beauty and natural wonder. Yet in them we also find unprecedented violence and racism. The social, political, and philosophical movements influencing Europe (among them colonialism, romanticism, capitalism, socialism, existentialism, and racism) followed the “pioneers” across the plains. This Writing Seminar will explore and analyze these tensions that seem to define the “American character”: the tribal versus the rugged individual, progress and our disregard for the natural world, tolerance and the intolerable, nostalgia for a vanishing landscape in the wake of unbridled development, law and order and frontier justice. These mythic tales about the promise of America continue to fascinate and frustrate. All of it-- the ‘good the bad and the ugly’-- have contributed to the representations of what it means to be “American.” <br>To help us consider questions of genre, the course will consider stories and essays by American and Native American writers. We will begin with The Sun’s Myth, a story in the oral tradition of the Kathlamet Chinook, and a Navajo Night Chant, House Made of the Dawn, translated by Washington Matthews and Dorothy Johnson. Students will be asked to engage in a close formal analysis of a range of visual and written texts, from John Gast’s painting, American Progress, to the essay “Manifest Destiny –A Belief System that Created a Nation,” to the journalism of Jane Cazneau and an excerpt from the Journals of Lewis and Clark. To help us reckon with the ethics of storytelling and representation we will consider “classic Westerns” such as High Noon and The Magnificent Seven, and “revisionist Westerns” such as Thunderheart, Little Big Man, as well as  Reel Injuns (2009), a documentary by Cree filmmaker Neil Diamond.</p>",

It seems that no single argument - legal, political, or ethical - adequately captures the principal views on the justice of the phenomenon and that perspectives on these questions are as diverse as the individuals and groups who either implement them or are the object of interventions.

As global emergencies and internationally funded responses dictate the conditions of life in more and more places, they also inspire new forms of aesthetic experience and engagement. Aid agencies sponsor art and media through sensitization campaigns and the promotion of local craft industries. They and their beneficiaries also arrange the perception of everyday living, whether through the choreography of resource distribution, the sculpting of infrastructure, the architecture of refugee camps, the staging of post-conflict justice and reconciliation, or the orchestration of political participation. Such projects mobilize the senses in ways fundamental to their reception, implementation, and impact. While policy-makers define development and humanitarianism through rhetoric that vacillates between morality and pragmatism, the aesthetics of such interventions often determine which problems are visible or invisible, which people are audible or inaudible, and which acts are sensible or senseless.</p><p>Prerequisite: Must be a first-year Abu Dhabi student.</p>",

Yet if spectacle is merely façade, why has it proved to be such a powerful tool in so many historical, geographical, and cultural contexts? Rulers and masses envision society through public display: rallies, demonstrations, festivals, rituals, trials, executions, etc. Such events both reveal and mask struggles over governance, privacy, globalization, religion, tradition, and change. This FYWS surveys an array of spectacles in order to discern how they work and to whose benefit: the spectator or the spectated? Course materials include model case studies from anthropology, political science, philosophy, and performance studies, as well as visual texts including film, photography, and social media. Writing assignments will challenge students to describe, analyze, and contextualize political power and its expression, leading to a sustained research paper on a topic of their choice. Students will pay particular attention to how their writing balances between word and image, between charged emotion and academic rigor, and between themselves and their publics.</p><p>Prerequisite: Must be a first-year Abu Dhabi student.</p>",

Asking if it’s “Hot enough for ya?” in 2018, after a decade of escalating temperature records, means contemplating nothing less than the end of the world. Set aside, for a moment, fears of rising seas, failing monsoons, and ancient pathogens released from soggy permafrost: how do we rewrite the stories we tell about our place in the world, now that we’ve grown big enough to break the weather? <br>This writing seminar investigates the philosophical, narrative, and moral fallout of global warming. By close-reading the climate through a wide variety of texts (including journalism, philosophy, poetry, policy, prophecy, science fiction, and manifestos), we’ll begin answering the questions that await us all in the decades to come: How do we tell the story of climate change? Where do we imagine ourselves among its many possible futures? In a final library paper, students will examine a contemporary case study to weigh the moral dilemmas this warming world presents.</p>",

We’ll use philosophical texts, journalistic essays, film, fiction, podcasts, and reality television to ask: What does it mean to be a global citizen, and who can become one? What does the cosmopolitan worldview offer us? Why might we be wary of patriotism, and when might we embrace it?

Considering each city as shaped by the ways citizens “practice” their everyday activities, students will examine different ways each city is represented in film, fiction, travel narratives, and scholarship from such fields as media, literary, and postcolonial studies . In the case of Abu Dhabi, students will also experience the city as pedestrians. Writing assignments include one essay on each city, each increasing in complexity, and each following different lines of inquiry: How is the city represented and shaped in different media? What are its stereotypes? Its conceptions of otherness or cosmopolitanism? What is urban culture and how does it differ from national culture? Who gets to claim a city as home?

Can a concept like synesthesia - the connection between different senses - allow us to write expressively about smells, describe and analyze fragrances or flavors, or argue about scent's place in a hierarchy of human senses? Readings include classical and Islamic philosophy, religious texts, medieval alchemy and sorcery, modern philosophy, psychology, anthropology, and the history of science. Field trips to perfumeries, gardens, art exhibitions, restaurants, and campus laboratories allow for interviews with a range of practitioners. Digital exercises enable the analysis of complex chemical data.

This course seeks to explore these questions on science in society and knowledge management by drawing on readings from the history and philosophy of science, as well as contemporary scientific controversies. The first essay will be based on a close reading of Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions and Galilei’s Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, which provide a philosophical and historical grounding for the course. The second essay will construct an analytical framework centered on writings by Orwell and Sagan that debate the proper way for societies to manage and interact with the ever-expanding body of scientific fact-based knowledge.

Abolition was a revolutionary act that put an end to the legal sale and ownership of human beings. However, official abolition often coexisted with new or old forms of systemic labor exploitation, political domination, and violence. This FYWS invites students to explore this paradox of change and permanence across cultures in Africa and the Atlantic world. How did different economic structures and geopolitical dynamics determine the lived experiences of servitude and liberation? To what extent did religion influence slavery systems and emancipation processes? How did enslaved and freed people in the colonies shape the theory and practice of European abolitionism? Perceptions of freedom and slavery in the nineteenth century were different from ours, and so the course will seek to understand how these fluid ideas shaped people’s lives in real ways.

Yet debates about how such representations relate to real-world brutality often overlook how definitions of violence hinge on concepts as disparate as nature, culture, force, injury, deprivation, and desire. Such mutations of meaning are not mere semantics; how we represent violence defines our response to it. Playing on the term \"graphic,\" this FYWS explores the ways we write about and with violence. In their first essay, students engage with debates on violence’s entanglements with representation. Next, students synthesize theoretical perspectives on violence (e.g. postcolonial, feminist, Marxist). Finally, they tackle a research topic of their own choosing while comparing case studies from disciplines and domains including cinema, art exhibitions, and video games.

This FYWS explores a range of texts and media in which postcolonial writers, artists, and intellectuals negotiate issues of gender, class, identity, and culture in understanding the impact of feminism in decolonization. Students will explore cultural developments and political narratives in a range of genres and learn to analyze techniques and contexts of feminist and postcolonial thought and expression. Two interrelated concerns motivate the writing assignments: 1) What is the relationship between women's voices and their agency in the postcolonial context? 2) How do these writers mobilize the category of gender to negotiate understandings of individual and community in these regions?

Looking at contemporary creative nonfiction, memoir, and confessional writing by women from different parts of the world, this FYWS explores how women writers contest structures of power and articulate identities through self-representation. Drawing upon various genres of life-writing, the course falls into three parts: Between Cultures; Maternal Matrix; and Private Lives, Publicly.

However, what if this seemingly obvious connection of the falcon and the man, obscures and conceals an alternative reality in which falconry had been and is a female practice, where the human-animal relation is built on symbols and signs that explicitly highlight a certain kind of femininity?

The exponential rise in fake news, conspiracy theories, hoaxes, propaganda, misinformation, and disinformation would suggest that we're churning out much more of it than we used to. It's tempting to believe that our \"post-truth era\" is a strictly 21st-century phenomenon - driven by a lethal combination of new communication technologies, bad faith actors, and an increasingly polarized world. But in truth, the preponderance of nonsense has a long history - going at least as far back as when Plato called out Gorgias for being a fraudster or when Niccolò Machiavelli turned deception and equivocation into a public art form. It's also tempting to believe that so much of today's nonsense is little more than the social media protestations of an increasingly angry, distrusting, and disenfranchised mob. On the contrary, it's everywhere, and to some extent, we all knowingly indulge in it - smearing each other with our own nonsense and wallowing in the nonsense of others. It permeates almost every domain of our public lives - the media, business, law, politics, and corporate culture, but perhaps most troublingly of all where we should least expect to find it - in our intellectual culture: in the arts, the humanities, the social and natural sciences. So, what constitutes nonsense? Why is there so much of it around? What might we do to curb its spread? Why do some of us fall for it more than others? What can we do to call it out? And if we could wipe away all the world's nonsense, what might a world without nonsense look like? By drawing on the writings of Harry G. Frankfurt, G. A. Cohen, John Petrocelli, and Gordon Pennycook, these are some of the philosophical, sociological, and psychological questions we'll be exploring in the course.</p><p>Prerequisite: Must be a first-year Abu Dhabi student.</p>",

    "description": "<p>“May the Devil take thee!” In May of 1498, Portuguese mariners first set foot in Calicut, India, opening direct sea-borne trade connections between Europe and the East. These first words spoken by Moorish traders to the new Indian Ocean explorers, foretold the often violent, rapacious pursuit of profits, and European ascendency in the rich trading ports of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. \"Pirates, Drug Dealers, and Slave Traders,\" explores the dynamic intersection of historical forces and contemporary reflections, unveiling stories that resonate across time and geography. From collective resistance to the transformative impact on individual lives, we navigate the complex interfaces between history, culture, and identity in the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean. Through archaeology, history, science and sociology students investigate not just what we know, but how we come to know it. This First-Year Writing Seminar goes beyond a historical survey; it is a unique expedition to understand the rich cultural tapestry of the Indian Ocean world.</p><p>Prerequisite: Must be a first-year Abu Dhabi student.</p>",
